For a while the excitement and passion had been stolen from me, but these last few weeks I’ve felt it increasingly coming back. People finally stopped asking me, “Are you doing any shows right now?” so I no longer had to deal with the awkwardness of saying such foreign words for me: “No. I haven’t been auditioning for anything; I’ve got other things going on right now,” and seeing the look of concern from those that know that theatre always took precedence.

Today I watched a dvd of the last show that I did and was disturbed seeing how skinny I had gotten, how each weekend my costumes were falling off me more and more, remembering how every night was a struggle as I sat onstage behind the set trying not to cry as I listened to the lead sing “Nothing is too wonderful to be true,” and how I had wasted away because of what was going on in my life at the time; the person who I felt had help rob me of my passion and left me with a gaping hole in my life that theatre had always filled before.

After 3 years of never removing it (except while on stage), I took this ring off my wedding finger and tucked it away, mourning the loss of what I had felt my entire life, wondering why it was gone, and angry towards the person that was wreaking havoc in my life. In these past few months I’ve occasionally thought, “Maybe I’ll start auditioning again,” but could never bring myself to do it. That longing, that need, was still missing, and kept me frozen on the couch.

Now, over a year later, I feel that fire returning. The joy of thinking about doing a show, the yearning, the endless research, and the smiles and happiness that comes from just thinking about it all the time and preparing. The enthusiasm and motivation to put in the work necessary to get back in the saddle. I don’t think I realized how much I missed that feeling until it started to return. And so now I feel worthy once more of wearing this ring, and am surprised at how comforting and familiar it feels on my finger. Maybe it’s a return to myself, maybe it’s the start of something new. Either way I can’t wait to dust off the piano and my character shoes, and get back on stage again.
