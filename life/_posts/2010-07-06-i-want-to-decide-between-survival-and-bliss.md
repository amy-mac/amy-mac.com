The other morning I read this [article](http://www.marcandangel.com/2010/06/21/18-things-i-wish-someone-told-me-when-i-was-18/), and for some reason I just instantly felt a little better about life. Maybe I just needed a reminder of some of those things. I had a pretty good weekend overall. My cousin totally kicked my ass at the gym and I'm still hurting from the workout she put me through. Most things are now moved into my new apartment and I'll be moving the big things over tomorrow. I was really sad that my favorite mug broke and my biggest one, which is the one that PJ gave me for summer solstice a couple years ago, but I guess it just means I'll have to find some new awesome mugs, right? I've got a new bed, new desk, new tv stand, new kitchen table and chairs...and hopefully a new life. I was invited to a barbecue on the 4th of July at the house of a couple people who were in The Producers and I went because I had nothing else to do. It was the first time I've had something to do for Independence Day in many years. I ended up being there for 9 hours and not even realizing it. The time just flew by; I had a blast. I really wasn't expecting that at all. I was just enjoying myself the whole time, and eating great food (including my cherry pie and pecan pie). Some guy interrupted conversation at one point to say, "I'm sorry but can I just stop to point out how awesome it is that you look like a modern day Belle," and I thanked him since I love Belle but I really wasn't completely sure why he said that until a little later when I remembered that I was wearing a blue ribbon in my hair and my hairdo was just like Belle's :-)

So overall I'm feeling really good. Things are moving along quite nicely. I'm going to be purchasing my plane tickets to Spain any day now. I'm really looking forward to all kinds of auditions coming up. I'm still pretty stressed with everything going on at work, but that's how the summer usually is, and luckily Ronin helped me out with some design difficulties the other day when I was about ready to throw my hands in the air and give up.

Now if I can just get myself to the beach soon I'll be completely happy. A year without laying out by the ocean is no way to live.
