I haven't posted an update for a while on what's been going on with me, so definitely wanted to let people in on things, who don't use social media.

A month ago I started taking dance classes again. It's something that I like doing at any given time but usually time, money, and/or lack of options gets in the way. I'm excited that I was finally able to to find classes that work for me at [Dance/10 Performing Arts](http://dance10.org) in Alameda because it's right down the road from my house. I'm taking Tap, Broadway Jazz, and also a fitness class on Saturdays. I didn't realize just how happy it would make me to start dancing again, and hopefully it will also get me back in shape.

I just finished my first week working at a web developer at [Coupa](http://www.coupa.com). They're based in San Mateo and the development team has their own little loft a block away from headquarters. So far I really like the environment and the people. I haven't had to contribute to anything yet because they have all their new developers go through these books, tutorials, and a final project before they start working on the actual site. It is all stuff that I already know and have been doing but I thought I'd take the opportunity to have a refresher and it's a good thing because I needed the Rspec refresher. This upcoming week I might start working on actual bugs/fixes and it's a little intimidating to jump into a gigantic code base you're not familiar with, but I'm also excited and very happy to have joined the team.

I've been doing lots of trip planning for all the traveling Jesse and I are doing this year. Our trip to Virginia is already booked for April. We're hoping to finally make it to DisneyLand for a weekend in June. We're going to New York City for a weekend so that I can see the Cabaret revival with Alan Cumming as the Emcee, and since we'll be there anyway we're hoping to also see the new Bullets Over Broadway musical. We'll be heading to Portland, by way of Ashland, for our cousin Miranda's wedding. It'll be my first time in Portland, so that's exciting, also. Then to wrap it all up we'll be attending our cousin Rob's wedding in San Diego in October. A whole lot of traveling but we're not going anywhere for a while after that.

We've been trying to have people more often at our home, because neither of us socialize that much at it is and when we do we usually have to go to San Francisco or at least 30 minutes away in the East Bay, and we thought, "Why should we always have to go to everyone else? Why can't they come to us?" So far we haven't had much luck getting our San Francisco friends (which is all of them, from my end) to come over because they fear crossing the water, but I'm holding out hope.

That's about it. I should do more regular updates. My life isn't as boring as it used to be.
