A lot has been going on over the last month. I just got back from a 3 week business trip to Colorado for the [Aspen Winter Games](http://www.shiningstarsfoundation.org/our-programs/aspen-winter-games/). It was once again a big success, and my big project, as usual, was creating the slideshow for the banquet. Every year I am faced with the challenge of creating it on a time crunch with limited resources, but every year I get countless compliments on it, so I suppose I must be doing something right. Once I finish compressing the video I will be posting it online if anyone is interested in it. Past years can be found [here](http://www.shiningstarsfoundation.org/media/winter-games-slideshows/). One thing that really stood out to me was how much I really enjoyed getting a chance to work with video again. It made me long to pursue a career in video editing again, though I know it's not likely or practical. However, this is the first year that I was chosen to edit the entire Winter Games souvenir video that will be sent to all the kids, families, and volunteers, and I'm really excited about the project.

Speaking of video projects, I _finally_ added a video section to my portfolio on here. It doesn't have everything I want there yet, but it's a good start. I've been applying to a lot of jobs at startups, but so far haven't had much luck. I'm leaning towards becoming specialized in something that's popular right now to give myself an advantage but as usual cannot figure out exactly what I want to do the most. I was thinking about getting into UI design, but the passion just isn't there so far; maybe when I start getting into it more that will change. I don't know why all the things that I'm interested in the most aren't practical; I suppose it's part of the curse of being interested in too many things at once. Now that I'm back in town though I've hit the ground running and am really motivated to get a lot of things rolling. I've got some new business cards, I'm going to get out there and network, continue my education here at home for newer and better things, and I'm still apartment hunting in the city, though without a roommate now. Good things are on the horizon!
