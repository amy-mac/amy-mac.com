I'm trying to figure out how I can still be productive with my own projects even when I'm out of town, but I feel so disoriented without my iMac. I mean, I can access it remotely but it's a bitch to move around the big screen with my tiny laptop screen.

I often wonder why I don't write anymore and it kind of just occurred to me that I guess I don't have any stories in me. I often feel like I'm not creative with art and I guess I'm just not creative with writing either. There's nothing fictional floating around in me begging to get out, no dream occurring that I have to get down on paper. I've always been best at writing non-fiction and admired the ability of fiction writers to create entire worlds for their stories and characters. I've often thought as an adult that I just wasn't made to be a writer, but I still often think about my urges to have been an English major. What does this mean? Absolutely not trying to be funny, but really, what DO you do with a BA in English?

I wish that I wasn't interested in so many different things equally.
