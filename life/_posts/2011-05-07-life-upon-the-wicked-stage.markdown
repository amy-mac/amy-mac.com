I’ve spent my entire adult life living out experiences on stage instead of off it, and that used to be enough for me.

I got a small taste of the beauty of a real relationship and found myself no longer content to play pretend on stage. I decided that I wanted a life outside of the theatre, that I wanted more things, real things; that I wanted to really live my life out there in the world instead of living other people’s lives on stage. I had a Pippin-esque revelation, I suppose.

But now months later I’m starting to remember why theatre held such an allure in the first place. You get to experience all the life you might never get to live otherwise, and maybe it isn’t real, but it’s something. On stage I’ve been a lawyer, a heroine, a wife, a violinist, a crazy playwright, a follies girl, a waitress, a maid, even a bird, and much more. On stage I’ve had husbands and offstage I haven’t had an official boyfriend in 9 years. I suppose the lifespan of a theatre show made me accustomed to the short flings you’d experience in and around them. “What happens at the theatre stays at the theatre,” and that’s the problem, isn’t it? You’re still alone at the end of the day. I used to be okay with that, the life I was living in the shows, but now…I don’t know what I want.

I guess after 9 years of being a mistress I wanted something to call my own. I wanted to know what it feels like to be someone’s girlfriend. I want to be adored and cherished, to have someone to makes plans with and go out and about with; someone I could hold hands with in public and fall asleep next to at night. I thought, after all this time, that I deserve it, right?

But maybe the fictions on stage have made me believe they can exist elsewhere and they really can’t. Maybe a stage wife is all I will ever be, and maybe there isn’t anything wrong with that. On January 1st of this year I removed the theatre masks ring that I had worn on my wedding finger for 3 years. I was ready to “break up” with theatre and give my devotion to a man instead, when I once thought I would never love a man as much as I did theatre. I tucked it away in a drawer and haven’t pulled it back out since. It bothered that man that I said I would never get married and that I wore that ring on my finger. Then I find out that the brief taste of something real wasn’t actually real anyway. It was all fake, and the person was just playing pretend, except I bought into it because I didn’t think it was scripted.

So again, I find myself being attracted back to a stage where I can experience all the things that I might never experience in real life. I feel like apologizing to theatre for forsaking it, thinking that I could find satisfaction elsewhere. I suppose I’m not ready to throw the towel in on real life yet and make my return to the stage, but it is getting tempting. While I would love to know what it feels like to be someone’s girlfriend, I’m still picky and won’t settle on just anyone, and I think the likeliness of someone I’m interested in actually liking me back is nonexistent.

So can you blame me for wanting to spend time in a place where men get to pretend to be in love with me for a couple hours each night? Who cares if they’re gay 1/2 the time, right? ;-) I haven’t been a mother yet on stage though, and that is something I absolutely long for.
