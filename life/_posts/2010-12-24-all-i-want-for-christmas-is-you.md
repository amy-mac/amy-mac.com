It's hard to plan out my work schedule over the next few months with so much of my life up in the air right now. It's also nearing the time that I will need to start applying to new jobs. I've decided that I'm going to look for a high-paying job, regardless of whether it's in my career field or not, because the sooner I get out the debt, the sooner I can do all the things that I really want to do; which includes even more education.

There are some things I'm so excited about right now, and others that are dragging me down, which balances out into a very neutral place. Since I tend to rant on here more than rave, let's focus on all the good things.

* I have two new books to read. _Geek Love_ by Katherine Dunn and _What is the What_ by Dave Eggers.
* I have a new instructional piano book to further my skill.
* I have eggnog to drink AND eggnog cookies!
* I'm going to be getting the professional massage that I've been wanting since time began.
* I saw The Nutcracker performed by the San Francisco Ballet!!
* I have a new RPG to play for the first time in years. ^_^
* I actually have something to do for New Year's Eve this year! (though truth be told I'm worried about getting lonely, but I guess I'd be lonely if I was at home too, so might as well be doing something, right?)
* I'm actually getting caught up on my to-do list at work, which is great with Winter Games right around the corner.

I really hope I get some specific things cleared up before the end of the year. I don't like operating on confusion and uncertainty.
