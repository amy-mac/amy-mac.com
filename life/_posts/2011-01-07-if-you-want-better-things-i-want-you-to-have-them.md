It is now been a week since I had my epiphany on New Year's Eve while zoning out during the Pomplamoose set at the Dresden Dolls concert, and it's been the first week in a very long time that I've consistently felt this good about myself and my life. Obviously the Care Bears were on to something! I bought myself an iPhone and am absolutely in love with it. I've been tracking my mood since the beginning of the year with an app.

The show opens in two weeks and I'm looking forward to having my weeknights off again, if only to get some more reading time in; I'm in book heaven at the moment with so many options to choose from. My traveling starts again soon, well the day after the show closes, but then after March I'm released from my contract and am free to pursue new adventures. It's both scary and exciting of course, but I'm sure whatever happens will be good and beneficial to my life.
