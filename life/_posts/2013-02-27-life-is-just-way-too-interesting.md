LIFE IS JUST WAY TOO INTERESTING AND FASCINATING, I JUST CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

When I was 18 my psychologist said that I was like someone walking through a forest who constantly was stopping and going, "This is a really cool tree...wow THIS one is really great too, but look at this one, wow all these tree are just so cool."

I'm constantly overwhelmed by being SO interested in so many things, and today it made me want to scream. As I thought to myself for the hundredth time, "I really need to start working on my French again," I immediately went, "AHHHHH!" and said, "No, no, NO." I just can't take this. I keep trying to prioritize my interests, and just can't seem to let go of still wanting to do the other ones. I micromanage my time at home, scheduling every hour of my evenings, and I can't make it work. I always have to sacrifice something else. I can't fit into my personal time all these things: pleasure reading, educational reading, coding, knitting, playing piano, practicing other languages, exercising, cleaning my house, performing theatre, dance classes, video games, and watching movies. Then on top of that my cat wants attention, and my fianc√© wants attention, and I feel guilty about hardly ever seeing friends/family. Oh yeah, and there's that whole wedding thing I keep forgetting about because I'm distracted by a hundred other things.

At least half the things I want to do with my time usually just don't happen, but I long for them. I am in a perpetual state of feeling behind because I need to unpack, or run errands, or clean house but there's not enough time for everything. No amount of to-do lists or micromanaging my time are going to make it all fit in. So obviously I need to learn to let go of some things. I need to cull my interests, but when you're equally passionate about all these things in the world around you. How do you do that?
