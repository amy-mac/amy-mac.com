Now that I'm feeling so motivated I had a harder time focusing at work today; all I wanted to do was work on the new website. I haven't been taking a lot of time for myself lately, but I'll be able to take more time off on my trip because of it. I'm just so anxious to get started on so many things.

I'm exhausted. I think I'm going to have to turn in early tonight.
