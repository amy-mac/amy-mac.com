In other words, my longing to be Olive in Spelling Bee.

How could that happen? That is one of the few things I never have to worry or think about. Of all the things to go wrong during an audition, I forgot the damn words. I'm just beyond floored this happened. I blanked and then I froze and stared at the pianist helplessly. They let me start over but then I was so worried about messing up again that I forgot to act and be expressive while singing which is another thing I usually don't have a problem with; all kinds of fail. For once I actually sang well but in this case that didn't matter. John knows I can sing, but he doesn't know that I can act and I blew it. At least I can still try out for TVRT's Spelling Bee in a couple of weeks but the chances of getting into that one are even more unlikely as there will be 100 other women trying out. That inner voice keeps beating me up again telling me to go back to the ensemble where I belong but this is only the 2nd time I've ever wanted a role so badly. I have to at least try, right? Even when there's no hope.

I went to visit my grandmother today. We talked a lot, which is getting easier to do now that she's losing her mind. She asked me, "So what's new?" 5 different times, so I can just repeat the same boring things over and over. At one point I said, "I just spend most of my time working," and she said, "You'll hate it when you're older."<br>
"Hate what?"<br>
"Being alone all the time. Not having any friends."<br>
"I have friends, Grandma."<br>
"That come over all the time?"<br>
"Well...no...but that's because they live in other states."

Silence. I look out the window and start to feel sad. Thanks for pulling up my insecurities Grandma.

So, it's been quite the defeating day. When I got back to my apartment I just wanted to crumple up on the floor and retreat within. I feel exhausted. Yesterday morning I longed for someone to just hold me while I cry out all my stress and sadness and thought, "I haven't had someone to do that in a long time," and then realized, "Wait...yes I have, they just turned their back on me directly afterwards."

Alas, I must pack for my trip and figure out how to get the BART station in the morning. Hopefully no more people will help dredge up the regrets I've buried inside me anytime soon.
