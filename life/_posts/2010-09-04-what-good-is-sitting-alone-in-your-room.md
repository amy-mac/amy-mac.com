Reading [this article](http://the99percent.com/tips/6842/99-excuses-for-not-making-ideas-happen) really got me thinking.

I recently realized that I'm no longer a doer. I don't know what the opposite of that would be, but I've become a person of inaction. I am constantly reading, learning, and planning and I realized that I could easily spend the rest of my life doing just that. I'm always telling myself that I don't know enough yet, that I'm not ready, and trying to plan for the future when the time will be right, but one day I'm going to wake up and realize that my life has passed me by and I never actually did anything. I used to be a doer. I used to jump in head first, not concerned if I had enough knowledge about what I was doing, and if I hit a roadblock then I addressed it and moved past it and continued doing.

I've always been afraid of failure, more than anything else. Sometimes that fear causes me to not even try in the first place, and sometimes that fear sabotages me from doing well; such is the case when I sing at auditions. I know you always hear that the true failure is to not even try, and that's really starting to hit home for me. I plan and plan and never do. So what I do about this? I mean I make lists about what it is that I need to do to make things happen, and where is that getting me? I can't just go blindly out into the night believing that things will just happen. So maybe there is a necessary balance between planning and implementation.

I guess it would help to know what it is that I even want to achieve anymore. Sometimes I'm not so sure.
