I don't post a lot on Facebook, and when I do it's often being shared from somewhere else, even photos and videos. It's mainly a place where I share those things of my kids or engage with my theater friends. I haven't even had the Facebook app on my phone in 4 years. I'm not particularly a fan of Facebook as a whole, but it has its uses. But I especially don't post links or news a whole lot there. My main social medium of choice is Twitter. Twitter is where all the news and opinions are shared, but it tends to be an echo chamber, and not used by a single family member of mine.

I've heard friends say that when they go on Facebook all they want to see is pictures of people and posts about how people's lives are going, and they hate it when it's nothing but links and random stuff. I agree with this. But after the events in Charlottesville last weekend, I've realized that something has to change.

I suppose that I'm lucky that the majority of people I know are good people, progressive people, dare I say it: liberal people. But in a way luck doesn't have a whole lot to do with it. I've never been shy about shutting out people in my life who aren't good people, treat me badly, or just have really horrible opinions and beliefs. Sometimes the reason for that is because I just can't stand conflict. I have a very physical reaction to it, and get really sick to my stomach. I'm sure this is part of my PTSD from my childhood, but that's another story. So I avoid conflict like the plague. Unlike my husband, I don't enjoy engaging with people of differing opinions/beliefs online. The night of the 2012 American presidential election some of my father's family members were spewing out horribly racist and inaccurate information on Facebook. I tried to engage with them reasonably but was very quickly attacked by all their friends with more racism and inaccurate information. So I blocked those family members right then and there, and said "Good riddance."

Then there are the family members I have who I worry about because they're not on social media, but they live in rural areas and watch Fox News, and it brainwashes them. I mentioned to them once that Fox News is known for spreading misinformation and inaccuracies, and they said to me incredulously, "But why would they lie?" And that's just it, this person is one of the best people I know in life, with a heart of gold, but they'll believe whatever they hear on the TV if it comes from a "news" program.

So why am I bringing all this up? Because when I was scrolling through Facebook this morning I saw a family member share an article about "what really happened in Charlottesville" that was filled with inaccuracies and bullshit, and I almost ignored it, like usual. I was going to scroll right past what I knew was bullshit, from its headline, and then stopped myself and said, "No". I opened up the article and I read most of it and knew that I had to speak up. I had to say something. I'm always wondering what more I can do to combat ignorance and make the world a better place, but I haven't been willing to have uncomfortable conversations. I keep telling myself that it's useless trying to have discussions with these people because they just bury their heads in the sand, or hurl insults, and it doesn't make a difference anyway.

But as I've seen many posts on Twitter say over the last few days, "_White people, you got to own this_" and it is our job to be out there educating our ignorant relatives. So yeah, it's going to annoy my friends who all have the same beliefs about civil rights and equality, or the people who just want baby pictures and puppies, and I'm sorry for that, but Facebook is about to get a whole lot political on my timeline, because I can no longer afford to keep it on Twitter if I want to make a difference.
