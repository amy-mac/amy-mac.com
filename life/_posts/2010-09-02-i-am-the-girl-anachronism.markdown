Once again I find myself wondering how I get myself into these situations. I'm tearing out my hair in frustration; can't focus because I'm tired and depressed, which also makes me feel stressed out. Why can't I just be normal?--a thought I've wondered countless times in my life. I forced myself to go out of my comfort zone and now I just feel tangled and ensnared with no idea how to make things right. I'm really angry with myself that I let this happen; I deserve the remorse that this situation will bring.

Today I can't help but feel hate for myself, for so many reasons. And I think the thing I hate the most is that it suddenly makes me miss that best friend all the more. Damn him for showing me what it was like to have a true connection with someone; something that now seems so dreadfully lacking in every one else and damn him for it not meaning anything to him.
