I think I have a few good monologues to choose from in _Sense & Sensibility_ for my _Pride & Prejudice_ audition. I'm really looking forward to working through a straight acting piece; it's been WAY too many years. In fact, I'm feeling a little rusty, and that worries me. I'm going to be ushering a few shows next month, and that's really exciting. There's nothing like getting to see shows for free!

I've had a very different week than normal and it feels kind of surreal. I'm looking forward to seeing where this new journey will lead me, but also trying to remain conscious and not forget myself. The only thing that sucks about actually having things to look forward to is that I then have trouble concentrating on the here and now. This week started out a little unproductive but I think it's getting back to normal now. Maybe I'll actually get some of my website finished over the weekend!

In other news, I have discovered a love of a new comic site. It's called [The Oatmeal](http://theoatmeal.com/). [This is my LIFE](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/working_home).
