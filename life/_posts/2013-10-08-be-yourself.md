As I was putting on my Sailor Moon shirt this morning I remembered my Aunt telling me a few years ago that no one would ever want to date me unless I stopped wearing "little kid" shirts. Thank goodness that I didn't listen to her, or else I might not have caught the attention of a kindred spirit, to whom I'm now married, and happier than I ever thought I could be.
