I was reading a review of Generic Theatre's _Closer_ and was completely struck with how much this sentence reminded me of Paul:

> He wants excitement and danger, and heâ€™s prodding himself into self-destructive experiences for the thrill of believing himself more important than he actually is.

Oh ye who said you didn't want to be a lothario, and look what became of you. PJ and I keep discussing theories about what happened. I keep telling him that the thing that makes me sad the most is that Paul is no longer the same man I befriended. I first started to notice the change in April but didn't realize it completely until June. The best friend I had is dead, and who knows, maybe my world is better without him. He's lost and confused and maybe someday he'll regret losing the close friend he had in me, but it won't matter anymore because I lost all respect for him. It's funny, that first time we were together he told me right afterwards that he felt great because he felt like I respected him. He was evidently willing to lose that, and did it make him happier? I guess I'll never know. The bitter side of me wishes that people knew the truth about him. He's admitted himself that he shows the world a lie, that no one knows who he is; I don't know why I didn't listen to him all those times he expressed sentiments along those lines.

Was I blind, or was I willing to give him the benefit of the doubt? I was certainly too trusting of his character. I suppose that's not the first time that's happened. Maybe I'll be better in the future.
