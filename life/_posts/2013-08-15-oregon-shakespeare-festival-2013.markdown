The first show we were going to see in Ashland was _Cymbeline_ in the Elizabethan Theater (which is an outdoor theater) but due to the wildfires and thick smoke they canceled the show, for the first time in the festival's history, due to health concerns. They continued to cancel all shows in that theater over the next few days and finally opened it up again just in time for the other show we were seeing in the Elizabethan. I'm glad that we got to enjoy the Elizabethan at all, under the circumstances, but I'm totally bummed that we missed out on _Cymbeline_.


## A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams


Having this particular play so fresh in my mind after reading it and studying it just 2 months prior made me enjoy this particular production a little less than I probably would have otherwise. From the minute Blanche first walked on stage I was thrown off by just how old the actress was. She was quite visibly in her 50's, maybe late 40's, and I couldn't stop wondering how they were going to get certain scenes and lines to work unless you just chose to pretend that the actress was 20 years younger. To provide some clarity to those who haven't read the play, Blanche is older than her sister Stella, but only by about 5 years, and so Stella is a girl in her 20's and Blanche is in her late 20's to early 30's. I find it hard to believe that they weren't able to find an age appropriate actress for the role, which means this must have been intentional but having Blanche old enough to be Stella's mother just ruined the illusion for me. All the other actors were very good, with the actor playing Stanley Kowalski being the most exceptional one. I thought the set was very beautiful and loved the effects of the rain coming down. All in all I enjoyed the show, despite taking a while to get into it due to Blanche.


## King Lear by William Shakespeare


This was by far the best Shakespeare play that I've seen in Ashland yet, including last year. I suppose that part of the reason for that is just that it's such a great play to begin with; not all Shakespeare's plays are masterpieces. This play is put on in the round and staged very well. I think there was only a single time that I wished I was sitting somewhere else because I was missing out on something from my vantage point. The actor playing King Lear was perfect in the role. We saw the same actor playing President Lyndon B. Johnson in All the Way last year, so I had high expectations for him in this show. He didn't disappoint, perfectly balancing a character that frustrates you in the beginning, but somehow makes you care for him by the end. Everyone else was good in their roles, especially The Fool, another actor that I was excited about after seeing him in Animal Crackers last year. My husband and I agreed that this was a pretty flawless show. I gave them a standing ovation, which is something I rarely do.


## The Taming of the Shrew by William Shakespeare


I've never been crazy about modernizing Shakespeare. My argument is that they're trying to do something new with something that is old and sometimes tired, but for those who have never experienced a play in its original setting, it can be disappointing to not see it performed that way. That being said, I did find the setting for this production of _The Taming of the Shrew_ to be delightful and effective. As so many people have stated, the original text of this play is not great. It features rampant misogyny and you have a hard time caring about most of the characters. I mean heck, even in _10 Things I Hate About You_ (based on _The Taming of the Shrew_), a movie that I outright love, I still want to strangle characters like Joseph Gordon Levitt for foolishly chasing the ditzy girl. Though, to that movie's credit, he actually believes there is more to Bianca than just beauty, unlike the original text. So when putting on this kind of play today, you really have to get creative with it to make it likable, and I thought they really did a great job of that. They put a BDSM twist on the characters of Kate and Petruchio, and I thought it really worked. All the actors were very good, though honestly I wasn't crazy about the actor who played Petruchio. I'm not even quite sure what bothered me about him. All in all though, good show.

When we walked out of the theater, Jesse's uncle turned to me and said, "You know Amy, Kate really kind of reminded me of you." I told him, "Yeah...I've gotten that a lot throughout my life." I suppose it isn't the best character for people to continually compare me to, but I think it's much more of a compliment than some others, certainly. Either way, Jesse has tamed me anyway ;-)


## My Fair Lady by Alan Jay Lerner & Frederick Loewe; original story by George Bernard Shaw


I didn't buy the transformation of Eliza Doolittle in this production of _My Fair Lady_. Maybe that's the fault of the director who had this whole concept of doing away with the illusion of theatre and ramming it down your throat that you're only watching a bunch of people in costume pretend. When the actors are good enough you can watch them perform in an empty room with no costumes and still believe what they're saying and doing, but in this case she put up a giant neon sign that said, "Look! We're doing a play." Okay, so the neon sign above the stage actually said, "_My Fair Lady_" but you get the point ;-) The set was minimal with nothing but the back wall, some risers with chairs so the actors could be on stage at all time, costume pieces strewn all over the place so that they could change on stage, and two pianos where the pianists played the music for the show center stage. Before the show began the woman playing Eliza addressed the audience out of character. I think this was a bad choice and part of what took away from the illusion. She was also a little older than Eliza is supposed to be, but I don't think that would have bothered me if her whole demeanor hadn't been so sophisticated. It was why I didn't buy the transformation. She was ALREADY a well-bred lady from the get-go. Even when she was supposedly playing the dirty ruffian who abuses the English language, all I could see was a woman pretending to talk slightly bad (it really wasn't all that bad compared to some of the Elizas I've heard). Her voice was beautiful when she sang the songs. I enjoyed hearing her sing, but I never once saw her as a character. Everyone else in the show, despite the director intently trying to ruin the illusion, was quite believable and enjoyable, with the actor playing Henry Higgins especially exceptional. I wanted to strangle him more and more every moment, which means he did a fabulous job.


## The Heart of Robin Hood by David Farr


Going into this show I don't think I was as excited about it as everyone else was. I'm certainly a fan of Robin Hood stories but I guess I just didn't expect a lot out of a new one. This was the U.S. premiere of a new play, and it was fun in that it was in the Elizabethan theater, and there was swinging from ropes and a bit of dancing. What I was most excited about going into this show was getting to see Howie Seago, a deaf actor who does shows there every season. We didn't get to see him yet since _Cymbeline_ had gotten canceled, and I really enjoy his performances. He didn't disappoint. I've decided that I like the guy who played Robin Hood better in comedic roles than dramatic ones. We saw him as the lead in Henry V last year, and it's not that he's bad by any means. I just think he becomes so much more when doing comedic roles, like the one we saw him in the night before in _Taming of the Shrew_. I enjoyed the guys who played his "merry" men much more. There really isn't a lot else to say about this play, except that it was my least favorite of the week. It was light-hearted, simple, and nothing about it was extraordinary.


## The Unfortunates by Jon Beavers, Ramiz Monsef, Ian Merrigan, and Casey Hurt; additional material by Kristoffer Diaz


This was a highlight of the festival and a really good note to end on. This was the world premiere of this musical, and none of us really knew anything about it before we went in. I had read the first line of the summary that mentioned men in a POW camp who are trying to keep each other's spirits up, and reading only that line made me think this was going to be entirely different than it was. What a pleasant surprise! During the show I kept thinking, "I have no idea what's going on but I don't care because this is awesome." Most of the show ended up being a mix of fantasy and flashbacks taking place in a New Orleans bar early 20th century. First off, the music in the show was fantastic; it was a mix of blues and hip-hop that we loved so much that we bought the CD in the lobby after the show. It's actually available to listen to on Rdio too, if you're at all interested in it:



The choreography was also fantastic. I would have loved to see this show a 2nd time. All the actors and characters were great. I think my favorite was King Jesse and the two rooks. This show also got a standing ovation from me. We listened to the CD on the drive home directly after the show, and we've continued to talk about it and reiterate, "Damn that was an amazing show." Definitely one of those that you get lost in while watching it.
