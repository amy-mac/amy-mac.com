Last night I showed _Working_ (the musical) to Jesse. It was the first time I'd watched it in a couple years and as I watched these people I used to know, I couldn't help thinking, once again, about how sad it is that really close friendships can go away over night or you just get fed up eventually. Lately I've been thinking that if you get to know anyone well enough, that they're bound to disappoint you at some point. I suppose that's very pessimistic, but it's been true in my life. It made me think, maybe everyone does bad things and if you don't know the dark parts of someone, then things go along fine, but once you know the truth then it doesn't work anymore.

I'm not trying to create an argument for not getting close to people. I often lament that fact that I am not closer to the people I've made friends with locally this past year. It's just that most of the people I've been closest to in my life I have to stop communicating with, for some reason or another. Maybe I just become close with all the wrong kind of people, but I still think it's more what I said before, that if you know anyone long enough, and well enough, they're going to do things you don't agree with, or they change too much, or they don't change enough.

Maybe in the end, finding the right kinds of close friends is just as hard as finding the right kind of partner. I just know that the older I get, the harder it seems to try and make friends at all, so it's especially disappointing when the long-term close ones fade away.
