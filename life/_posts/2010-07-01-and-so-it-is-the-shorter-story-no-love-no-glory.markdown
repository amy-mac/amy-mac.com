So many things going on right now! I have a new apartment that I will hopefully get most of my stuff moved into this weekend. I realized the other day that it's been 4 1/2 years since I last had an apartment completely to myself. I couldn't believe I've been living as a hobo that long, but I guess that explains the dust on my stuff in storage and the memories of the items in there shocking me into the past. So it's pretty exciting moving into a place that I'll be able to enjoy all to myself as a hermit once more. I keep thinking back to the past places I lived in alone, and it was definitely a quiet life.

I enrolled in a community college in Oakland. Classes are too cheap here to not take advantage of them, even if it's just taking one dance class a semester, etc. There already doesn't seem to be enough time in the day for all the education and knowledge I crave, but sleep is for the weak, right?

I went to the doctor to get my thyroid checked and had my first ever bloodwork done. A lot of things costing me money lately, so I'm pretty broke but I feel like it's okay because things are progressing, and that's what is creating it. There's nothing wrong with my thyroid, and I'm not anemic, everything else is good too, BUT my vitamin D is extremely low, so the doctor says I have to start taking 5,000 mg a day and that in a couple months I might be feeling a little better. We'll see.

I haven't had any time to work on my website lately. I've been totally swamped at work. I've basically been doing nothing but artwork and it's taking up all my time. All these deadlines are occurring at once, so I've been having to put in a lot of extra hours. I can't complain though, I am very lucky to get paid to do artwork. My iMac is finally back into my hands and it's oh so glorious, though I'm having trouble once again trying to deactivate my CS3 on my laptop, so right now I can't use InDesign on my iMac >.< Oh, on that note, I was able to get Dreamweaver CS5 from TechSoup when we put in our nonprofit order so looking forward to giving that a whirl sometime soon. I upgraded my iPod Touch to 4.0 and it keeps startling me when the icons move differently than they use to. Checked out iBooks and I guess it's okay, but you still can't curl up with that--it's not a substitute, it's a backup; at least that's how I feel.

At first I was doing pretty okay, I went from sadness to numbness then to anger, and then back to sadness and bursting into tears in public places. I've been having some pretty bad dreams too. Right now I think I'm more frustrated than anything. I congratulate myself whenever I realize I've gone a moment, sometimes even an hour without thinking about any of it. When I do think about it I reassure myself that a day will come when none of it will matter, like so many times before; though I'm dead set on there never being another instance like this in my life. I'm trying to continue life as normal, keep looking ahead and pretending like I'm just fine. It's back to living in my head again, bottling it all up, until I burst. I watched _The Young Victoria_ the other night and at the end I was crying and couldn't stop. I cried myself to sleep that night. I was upset because it was a lie, like everything else and everyone in life. I don't care that it was based on real life; it only upset me more that it was, because I want something real and something true, and love simply isn't.

He laughed at me for protesting that no one likes me or misses me and days later he neither liked me or missed me anymore. PJ says people don't just change their feelings overnight but he's naive. He says that I can't take people so literally, but he doesn't understand. I know he feels nothing, nor probably will ever spare a thought towards me again, and that's what frightens me. I don't know how I could ever be that close to someone again without being afraid that they'll stop being my friend the next day. I think it wouldn't bother me as much if I hadn't gone from one extreme to the other in 48 hours. Mais c'est la vie, n'est pas?

So what do I do? I keep to myself, I do the little things that make me happy, and one day we'll all join nonexistence. I plan on making use of every one of my minutes and making of them what I can. Today is the first day of the rest of my life.
