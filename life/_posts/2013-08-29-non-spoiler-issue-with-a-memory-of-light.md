I've decided that my biggest issue with the last book of the Wheel of Time series (_A Memory of Light)_Â is that there is no epilogue. You read 14 books about the same characters and get so invested in their lives, and then you don't even get an epilogue to know what happened to them after the events of the series. Yes, I realize that Robert Jordan might not have left notes about what happened to them afterwards, and we'll just never know and can only speculate, but I'm saying it's criminal.

I have other issues with the last book, but that's the one that is still bothering me a month after finishing it.
