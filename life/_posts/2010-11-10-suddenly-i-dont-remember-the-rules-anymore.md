I think if it weren't for being able to talk to PJ about my life and problems that I would probably go stark raving mad. I always feel so happy and good after talking to him and I think it's because of the release of stress I get just getting to talk to someone who understands.

Rehearsals started for _Dirty Rotten Scoundrel_s last night. It was a very short rehearsal, being that it was just orientation, and afterwards I was a bit melancholy because I didn't want to go home yet. Nights have been getting harder again lately. Maybe it's the changing seasons and the darkness. Suddenly nights feel especially lonely and my mind wanders. Last night after I got off the phone with PJ I was going through texts and realized I still had a bunch of texts from Paul on my phone. I don't have him as a contact in my phone anymore, but still have the texts. I wondered why I don't delete them, what purpose do they serve? And I thought it's probably the same reason I never deleted Jonathan's profile off of Brain Age. Holding on to some small piece of the past, a record that they were there once, that maybe I was important in someone's life. Maybe I just can't erase people. I know I should learn how.

On the brighter side of life, my boyfriend got my an iPhone! Which is really super awesome and exciting. I also got my front tooth fixed yesterday so now I can start smiling again. Still trying to figure out this career and education thing yet again. I finally started learning Adobe AfterEffects, because you know I needed yet another thing to take up my time and to keep up with (note the sarcasm). But who knows, maybe I'll have as much fun with animation and effects as I did in high school and discover yet another possible career path.
