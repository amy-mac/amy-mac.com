Another person to add to the list of people who don't even care that I'm out of their lives.

I'm not going to let myself dream again. Shouldn't have let myself this time. I knew it was too good to be true. He almost had me convinced that someone actually wanted to be with me.

I will never have a real relationship with a man. It's just not possible. No one wants me and when they do they treat me like crap.

I'm done.
