How much life has changed since I've last written. I keep wanting to write but haven't found the opportunity to with everything going on. So much thought and decisions have arisen surrounding my life and goals and where I'm going with everything. I went on my first ever vacation, which was spent in Spain, and I had nothing but time to think through everything.

Oh a whim I'm auditioning for _Dirty Rotten Scoundrels_ today. I don't care if I'm cast, and that makes auditions not scary. There are a ton of straight plays that I would like to audition for next month, so in a way I do hope I'm not cast. I know it would seem odd to even audition but there are definitely good reasons surrounding the reason why I am, one of which being that it's probably the last show I'll ever do with that company, and I do like the show. I just miss acting so much and it'll be another ensemble show where you just smile and look pretty.

I finally read _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_ after all these years. It was even more brilliant than I ever expected. Also read another great book for anyone who is into musical theatre. It was called _How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship, and Musical Theatre_. There was this section in it that I loved simply because it was like seeing my own words on paper:

> "You see, books fill the empty spaces. If I'm waiting for a bus, or am eating alone, I can always rely on a book to keep me company. Sometimes I think I like them even more than people. People will let you down in life. They'll disappoint you and hurt you and betray you. But not books. They're better than life."

I wish I had more time to read books, I wish I had more time for a lot of things. It's recently become apparent that I'm never going to be able to do all the things that I want to do so I really need to start making choices and focus more on the things I love the most. On that note, I don't think I am going to pursue becoming a video editor anymore. I'll discuss that in more detail later.
