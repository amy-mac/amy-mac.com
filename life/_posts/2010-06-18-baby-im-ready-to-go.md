I'm feeling very handicapped by my inability to produce the simplistic website index that I designed. You just simply can't do anything with basic html these days. I knew that; that's why I've stayed out of the game. Now I try and jump back in after all these years head first and am frustrated when I hit my head on a rock. I know that I can probably figure out the little I need to know by doing some reading up on the interwebs but am suffering from little personal time and sketchy internet. I certainly need to get myself focused on this project though to take my mind off of life's tragedies.

On the bright side of life, because I'm forced to operate from my laptop right now instead of my iMac I don't have to sit in the uncomfortable computer chair; I can sit on my bed. Hurrah.
