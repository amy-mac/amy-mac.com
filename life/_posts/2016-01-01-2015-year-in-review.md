Yet again it's been forever since I've posted because parenting and work keeps me super busy, so I rarely have time to even be on my computer. I miss blogging and there was no way I wasn't going to do my annual review, so at least there's some kind of an update.

    - Took Ada trick or treating for the first time

##November

6. Bought a new car (2015 Kia Soul) after 10 years with my 2005 Hyundai Elantra
7. Had a glorious 2 weeks off from work

It was a very busy, stressful, and exhausting year. It was also a very rewarding, happy, and exciting year. With the adoption behind us, and just a little more paperwork to do, I am very much looking forward to the upcoming year with my family and here's to hoping that I'll finally figure out how to have a social life again.
