  This isn't going to be all that much of a review, but wanted to document the experience somewhere. Yes, I finally saw _Hamilton_ which is currently touring in San Francisco at the Orpheum. I first heard about the musical in March of 2015, which is pretty late to find out about it considering that I'm usually more on top of what's going on in the theatre world and I was already a fan of Lin-Manuel Miranda. A musical from Lin-Manuel Miranda about Alexander Hamilton? I couldn't wait to tell Jesse, whom the previous summer gave me a history lecture about Alexander Hamilton and the election of 1800 after we passed by his statue in Central Park. Suffice it to say, we were both excited, for different reasons.

That summer I pre-ordered the original cast recording to give to Jesse for his birthday. It was to be released 2 weeks after his birthday, but it was released digitally a few weeks before that and we both became obsessed immediately. I remember after only listening to the first few songs thinking it was absolutely brilliant. I already knew Lin-Manuel to be a brilliant lyricist and somehow he had outdone himself with this show.

That fall we were also quite pleased to find out that there was already talk of a national tour, and in early 2016 it was announced that San Francisco would be the first tour stop. I never imagined we would be so lucky. I had always wanted to get a season membership with SHNSF and this finally sealed the deal for me. I knew there was no way that I was going to battle to get tickets when they went on sale to the general public after what it was like battling for Book of Mormon tickets the first time it came through San Francisco. So around March 2016 I bought Jesse and myself a season membership, content in knowing our tickets were secured.

In June 2016 when Hamilton sweeped the Tony's and performed a few different songs from the show, the excitement only grew. I couldn't wait to see more of the fabulous choreography.
