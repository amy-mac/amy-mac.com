I worked out today for the first time in a month. It was a kickass workout. Not only do I always feel great afterwards but it is also very therapeutic, turning aggression into productivity. My mind tends to wander when I'm exercising, and the angrier I got the harder I found myself working. I was also feeling really motivated because I simply do not look like my 21 year old self. I had a bangin' body at 21 and now I'm 25 and the unfortunate decline has set in, and I'm already experiencing the effects of that in my love life. Men choosing the new models; it's disgusting. Not that I really want a love life, but I just don't feel good about my self and my body any more, and I want to again. Not to mention I need to get my endorphins from somewhere.

In some ways I'm glad that I can't access the internet at my house right now. It gets me up and out of the house and when I am there I concentrate more on projects and am forced to be content hanging out with myself. It feels incredibly quiet though; as if I am in an airtight bubble where no communication can penetrate. I'm starting to think I like the quiet though. I'm submitting a rental application today for an apartment. I think my life is going to change when I move, in many different ways. I think I'll definitely be a workaholic again. I finally got inspired with my website yesterday. I wasn't happy with the initial forced design, and then had a spark yesterday and couldn't implement it fast enough. I had to get it out while it was in my system and I'm happy where it's going.

Back to real work now though; must pay the bills and all!
