> Let’s talk about the core assumption of this test in the first place. I subscribe to the notion that not all ideas need be given equal weight. Some of them are just wrong. There is such a thing as a basic fact you can test for. If you’re in school, and someone asks you “When was the Declaration of Independence signed?” on a quiz and you say “1965,” you don’t get equal weight or deeper consideration for your answer. You get a _fucking zero_ on that question, because your answer was wrong.

> Similarly: this test checks for knowledge of basic, simple facts. Any of these questions could be put on a quiz in any public school. Yes, even the cavemen one. Religious arguments can stay in Sunday school; we still teach science in public school, and natural history is a thing we learn there. [dealwithit.gif]

> On discrimination: is it actually bigoted to say I don’t want someone who’d fail _this specific test_ making decisions about what is and isn’t legal in this country? Is that a horrendous notion? It’s a question of qualifications, to me. We test people before we give them driver’s licenses: if you’re too dumb or uncoordinated, you don’t get to drive a car. Here, if you’re too stupid to pass this very simple test, you don’t get to steer the country. Is it a radical notion to think there’s a baseline level of competence required to be a participating citizen in a democracy? In my America, this is that level. Can we agree it’s not hard? _This test is not hard to pass._ There are no other tests.

> Lastly: there are no other consequences for the people who fail this test. You fail this test? You don’t go to jail. You don’t pay a fine. Nobody has to know you failed. The only result is you don’t get to have a say over what goes on in my life. Live yours! Seriously. Just stay out of mine. Who else watched [this video?](http://youtu.be/nY0M7IdNl7U) The people in this thing strike pure horror into the core of me. I don’t want them ruling my life, or anyone else’s.*

> The only possible weakness built into this test is if Barack Obama ever converts to Islam. Then we got problems.

> * The flipside: if this test is implemented, and some new shit starts to happen in government, does any of it actually concretely negatively affect the people who failed it? What could we-who-passed possibly vote into being that would harm a person who failed this test? I leave this as an exercise to the reader, ‘cause I can’t think of anything.
