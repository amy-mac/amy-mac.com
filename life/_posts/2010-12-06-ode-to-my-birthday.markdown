I Dreamed a Dream from _Les Mis√©rables_

There was a time when men were kind,<br>
And their voices were soft,<br>
And their words inviting.<br>
There was a time when love was blind,<br>
And the world was a song,<br>
And the song was exciting.<br>
There was a time when it all went wrong...

I dreamed a dream in time gone by,<br>
When hope was high and life worth living.<br>
I dreamed that love would never die,<br>
I dreamed that God would be forgiving.<br>
Then I was young and unafraid,<br>
And dreams were made and used and wasted.<br>
There was no ransom to be paid,<br>
No song unsung, no wine, untasted.<br>

But the tigers come at night,<br>
With their voices soft as thunder,<br>
As they tear your hope apart,<br>
And they turn your dream to shame.

He slept a summer by my side,<br>
He filled my days with endless wonder...<br>
He took my childhood in his stride,<br>
But he was gone when autumn came!<br>

And still I dream he'll come to me,<br>
That we will live the years together,<br>
But there are dreams that cannot be,<br>
And there are storms we cannot weather!<br>

I had a dream my life would be<br>
So different from this hell I'm living,<br>
So different now from what it seemed...<br>
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed...<br>
