"What's the point in all this screaming? No one's listening anyway."

I've been a fool and have once again let fantasy interfere with reality. Then one day you wake up and realize that your dreams aren't coming true; that you've been focusing on potential instead of what actually is. Well I can't keep living on someday, I've done that far too long. Wishing things were a certain way is not going to make them so, not where other people are involved because you can't control the way other people are. I feel as if I've been so blind. There really isn't anyone out there for me, is there? If I stand up for myself I end up alone, and I'm not going to stop standing up for myself. I'd rather be alone and miserable than with someone and miserable, because at least then I don't feel the unfairness and injustice.
