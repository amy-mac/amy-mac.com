I've been working at Coupa for a full month now. I like it. I feel comfortable there in a way I haven't felt since I worked for the Shining Stars Foundation in the glory days. I've lost track of the number of contributions I've made now. It isn't all that glamourous and sometimes my eyes glaze over from a full day of doing nothing but reading code, but I'm happy.

After an extremely busy year I'm finally starting to relax a little. I've been watching lots of movies with Jesse, doing more pleasure reading than educational reading, and auditioning for shows. The latter has been very depressing; at first it was my societal obligations interfering with shows I wanted to do, and now that I'm actually out there I'm just not getting cast in anything. Maybe I've gotten worse or maybe there are just too many good people in the Bay Area. Either way it's been over 3 years since I did a musical and my heart aches. Of course, I've never been great at singing at auditions because I get too nervous, but I've always been able to get by on my acting and dance skills and once I'm cast they're always pleased with my voice.

I was hoping to do even one show before having children, but now I don't know if that's going to happen. I worry this means it'll be another few years before I'll be able to attempt getting back on the stage again, and the older I get the more dream roles that slip away.

Dance classes are still going mostly well though. It's been really hard to get back into doing jazz. I have a different body now than I did when I used to dance and I'm no longer familiar with the way my body moves; it's like learning how to walk again. I almost gave up after a particularly bad night of feeling ridiculous amongst all the young dancers with better technique. I forced myself not to give up though and hopefully thing will get better. Tap dance is good though. I've always felt that if I'd ever get really good at a particular kind of dance, it would be tap. I love getting to be in regular classes again. I really want to stick with it this time for as long as I can. Maybe someday I'll be a tap dancing Christmas Tree (a local thing).

DisneyLand plans are starting to fall in place. I can't believe it's finally happening. Been struggling to find a good weekend to go to NYC though. Jesse's teaching summer school during the prime time to go and even though we're just going to be there for a weekend we'll still need a Friday. I must not miss Alan Cumming in _Cabaret_. I don't care what I have to do.

Currently reading _Geek Love_ by Katherine Dunn. I'll post my thoughts when done.
