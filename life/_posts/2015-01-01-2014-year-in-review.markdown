This is my first post since May, which is kind of crazy with how much I like to write and share things, but it’s been a very busy year, and for a few months I was sort of without a computer which makes it really hard to post things on your own website when you don’t have an online portal for doing so.

In the same tradition of last year, when I was also very busy, I’m going to do some bullet points about what’s been going on with my year, rather than my past tradition of sending out a newsletter to my loved ones.

This really was an incredible year, filled with traveling, loved ones, and dreams coming true. My only regret is that I didn't spend a lot of time with friends. Working in San Mateo makes it really hard to visit San Francisco during weeknights, and then when I got pregnant I became exhausted all the time, which made things even harder. Then I became a parent for the last part of the year, and those 3 things combined make it hard to have personal time, let alone visit friends. So to all my friends whom I've neglected, trust that you have often been in my thoughts and I miss you. I plan to have a social life again once I'm a little less tired and can make my schedule work better.

As good as 2014 was, I'm looking forward to 2015 even more because I'm sure it will be just as incredible as we soon welcome our 2nd daughter into the world.
