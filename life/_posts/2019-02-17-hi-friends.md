I’ve basically had no social life since I became a mother. Initially it was because I literally did not have the time. It was overwhelming becoming a mom overnight with Ada, while getting moved into a new place and being pregnant, then having 2 babies to take care of while working full time. All this while commuting at least an hour each way to San Mateo.

Those first couple years were stressful and it was all we could do just to get by. Then Jesse became a stay at home dad when Athena was 16 months old and Ada was 2 years old, and as the girls started to get older things got slightly less stressful in some ways, but continued in others. Working full time and commuting I barely see my kids during the week and had to cram all my time in with them on the weekends on top of getting things done around the house and managing finances. Up until one year ago I had my single hour of dance class each week for “me” time. Now that it’s a hobby I can share with both children, I treat myself to 4 1/2 hours of dance a week, though I feel guilty sometimes, but I justify it with needing the exercise.

None of this is out of the ordinary. This is typical of all working parents. Barely any time with kids and barely any time to themselves. Our kids still require very hands on bedtimes; we take turns each night, and I’m drained and exhausted at 9pm when I wander out after an average 45 minutes of waiting for them to go to sleep.

This is all to say that in the last 4 1/2 years I can count the number of times on one hand that I’ve gone out and done something with friends. Being introverted and having social anxiety doesn’t help either. Every now and then I’ll really try to make an effort and reach out to someone but if it falls through I lose motivation and another year goes by.

I’m fairly happy with my life. I’m not complaining. I enjoy being with my children, and I enjoy the time I actually get to spend with Jesse (which isn’t as often as you might think). But I keep seeing all these damn articles about how often women should go out with their girlfriends and I’m really starting to wonder if I should try more to have friends and a social life. I was never too good at it to begin with, but there are many people who I like hanging out with and would enjoy hanging out with more. It's also super hard to make friends as an adult though when so many people already have established friendships with other people.

Jesse often encourages me to go out, but it’s hard because I’m tired, and because I’m busy, but sometimes the best things in life are hard to achieve and I think this will be worth the effort. So I’m setting a new goal for myself, which is probably ambitious because of my track record, but I’m going to try to go out and do something with friends at least once a month. We’ll see how this goes!
