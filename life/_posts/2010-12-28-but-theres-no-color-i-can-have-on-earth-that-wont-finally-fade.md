Earlier this year I posted a Facebook status about how I realized that the source of my discontent was that on any given day I felt like I should be doing something extraordinary. A few people laughed and said, "Didn't you learn anything from Pippin?" For those of you who are unfamiliar with the musical, here is a summary:

> Once upon a time, the young prince Pippin longed to discover the secret of true happiness and fulfillment. He sought it in the glories of the battlefield, the temptations of the flesh and the intrigues of political power (after disposing of his father King Charlemagne the Great). In the end, he found it in the simple pleasures of home and family.

He whines through the whole musical about needing to find his corner of the sky, and sings about how he has to be extraordinary. Obviously it parallels to my own journey but I guess the answer was no, I didn't learn anything from Pippin. The finale of the show came on while I was working yesterday and upon truly listening to it for the first time in a while it dawned on me that I had my own Pippin-esque revelation within the last couple months that ended in the same result. My priorities have shifted. Performing used to be my entire life. I once said that life is all about performing in a show and everything else is just filler. I've been wearing my theatre masks on my wedding finger for almost 3 years to show my devotion, knowing that I'd never love a man or anything else as much as I did theatre. I've found myself caring less and less about performing these last couple months and I wasn't sure why. These days I sit in rehearsal and while I enjoy singing and dancing, I sit there wondering why I don't feel that spark or devotion anymore; the feeling that this is exactly where I'm supposed to be.

It's because I realized the same thing that Pippin did. I still love theatre but there's something I want more now, but instead of the realization bringing contentment to my life, it makes me kind of sad; because obtaining what I truly want now, is far more difficult than being cast as the lead in a show. No one's ever wanted to cast me as a lead in their life. I always fail the auditions. So what do you do?

Maybe I'll do as the great Jane Austen did and become a writer. It's too bad I suck at making stories up. Asides, I'm tired of living vicariously through fictional characters, or otherwise.
