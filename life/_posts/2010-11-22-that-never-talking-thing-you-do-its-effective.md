It's starting to get really embarrassing whenever family and friends ask about my boyfriend. I feel like I've been made a fool of. All that feeling that was developing is gone now. I don't feel like I'm in a relationship. I feel like I have an imaginary friend, except that I'm no longer content with talking to something that doesn't talk back.

But like Kathy said today, at least I have the show to keep me busy. That's all I ever seem to have, theatre to try and keep me content and happy until the run is over and the emptiness sets in again. I had 10 hours of dance rehearsals this weekend and every inch of my body is in agony. I can't make any small movement at all without wincing in pain. I guess I can't go from sitting down doing nothing all day to super intense dancing overnight. I'm certainly going to be in crazy awesome shape by January at this rate! I'm also really sick with a cold though and have no voice.
