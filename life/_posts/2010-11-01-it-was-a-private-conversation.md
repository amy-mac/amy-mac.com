> We are not of this world and there's a place for us, stuck inside this fleeting moment, tucked away where no one knows it, wrapped up in a haste and by mistake got thrown away...

This morning I took _The Perks of Being a Wallflower_ off the shelf to loan to my brother, as I think he might really like it and have been wanting him to read it. Upon taking it down I realized that there was a bookmark inside about half way through. I opened it up and Asa's business card for Atlas Productions was the bookmark. Suddenly I remembered the last time I read the book. I was reading it out loud to Asa January of 2006 when I went to visit him in LA. We never got to finish; it was marked where we stopped.

Every time I think I've gotten rid of every scrap of him another one pops up. Will there ever be a time to completely shut the door on the past? Really there are scraps of all of them floating around. Bits and pieces of people to remember them by. Sometimes I look at the Mario that Paul made for me and I get angry or it stops me in my tracks and I wonder if I should get rid of it. If they can pretend I never happened then I should be able to do the same, right? Sometimes I hear their voices in my head and it makes me upset all over again. It was just a moment in the woods, right? Life is just made of moments, fleeting moments and nothing more. Why can't memories be just as fleeting? Why can't I remember only the bad things instead of the good, so that I can justify the loss and never miss the place they left empty in my life.

And how can I ever believe another word anyone else says? I can't shake the vision in my head of Paul kissing me and saying goodbye and flashing that charming mischievous smile of his. I still can't reconcile that last image of seeing him with what came two days later, even knowing how much his personality changed in those last couple months. Maybe that's what plagues me most of all, is that I still can't understand any of it.

And yet they go on, all of them, happy and content, nothing missing from their lives. Am I so dismissible? Have I had an effect on no one? PJ told me the other night that there's an unspoken promise when you're friends with someone. You just don't expect friends to leave, you expect them to be so much more. It's easy when lovers leave you, you know you'll get over it and that you'll love again. When friends leave you though, that cuts to the core. Did Paul ever actually care about me, or was I always being used? It seems to me now, after everything, that I was just being used to help him survive his misery in his marriage. I was someone to talk to, to confide in, to make him feel good about himself, and then once he broke free of his marriage he just didn't need me anymore. He always used to tell me that he was a dishonest person, that no one saw the real him, that I had been with a string of bad guys including him. I still believed him, and believed in him, because of the close connection that we had. What was that connection worth? Nothing to him apparently. I still don't understand, maybe I never will. People change, I know that, I've just never understood the quick changes in people because I can't do it.

He lied to me, everyone lies to me. Tina thinks my current inability to feel love is because I'm letting my past affect me. I want to feel love, but I just feel so numb, and I don't seem to have any control over it. I have so much baggage. Sometimes I want to tell Tom√°s things so that maybe he'll understand, but I think some things are better left dead and buried. He doesn't seem to want to know anything about my past, or even much about me, and then he gets frustrated and I get frustrated, but I keep my mouth shut and retreat into my head where I am always lost in memories and thoughts I cannot share. I want to be wholesome and pure and made new, to start over and build from here. How can I do that? How can I do that when sometimes a few words transport me back to another time and place at lightning speed?

I'm broken. Who knows how to put the pieces back together? I sure don't.
