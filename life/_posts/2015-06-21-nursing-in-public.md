Recently my family went on a roadtrip to Idaho for my father's wedding. It was the first big roadtrip with the children, aged 4 months and 16 months and in order to give the girls sufficient time out of the car we stopped and ate at restaurants/diners for every meal. So of course it was during these breaks that I would try and nurse my 4 month old baby, Athena. Since we were driving through Nevada and Oregon during the summertime it was very hot and we were all tired from the drive; so while I normally try to cover up with a baby blanket while I'm nursing in public, I didn't do so a single time while we were traveling.

At first I was really nervous about it, not because I'm modest, but because I didn't want to offend anyone, or get any backlash about it. But I was increasingly amazed day after day as the trip wore on, that after eating out at least 10 times during the trip, never once was I asked to cover up or stop nursing my baby. The servers came and went like usual, and people passed by our table equally nonchalant for the most part. I really didn't expect this. I think people were more taken aback by my hair color than the fact that I was nursing my child.

So because there are stories in the news on a regular basis about women being asked to stop nursing or being told they were being indecent, I wanted to get a piece of positivity out there that there's hope in society being more accepting of the breastfeeding comeback, and yay for the people who don't try to sexualize the original, natural function of the breast.
