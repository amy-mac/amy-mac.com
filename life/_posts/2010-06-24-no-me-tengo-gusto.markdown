I don't know how some people slip in and out of different languages so easily. I keep mixing french into my spanish, and I'm so frustrated by it. I mean, I know that my experience with french has made it foremost in my brain and all, but what if I get used to using spanish and then start slipping spanish into my french? Maybe my brain can't handle multiple languages. I just want it to be neat and compartmentalized, ready to call forth at will. Maybe it's because I have trouble thinking before I speak. I mean, it's not like I don't know what the correct word is for both, it's that my brain doesn't always choose the correct one first. I watch bilingual and multilingual people every day and think that it can't be that hard when so many people are doing it. Maybe I'm too hard on myself. I usually am.
