Right now I’m job hunting, apartment hunting, and dealing with the robbery and insurance claims, and yet I haven’t gone off the deep end yet, and feel like somehow it’s all going to work out.

I thank Jesse for a lot of that, who has been a great source of comfort and support. It’s the first time in my life I’ve felt like I’ve had a real partner in life.

I feel pretty discouraged about the jobs though, as I don’t see why it will be any better than the previous 8 months that I was looking. I just don’t feel like I fit in anywhere. Thousands of jobs are posted on dice.com for the bay area, every day, and I’m not qualified for any of them. And I feel even less prepared than before for any new design pursuits, after losing all my files, work, and pretty resume. Obviously you never know what will happen if you don’t keep trying, so I do, but how long does it take until you realize you must just be a complete failure?

I started school again this summer because so many jobs won’t hire you unless you have a degree, and after making it most of the way through the semester I had to drop one of my classes, that I had an A in, just because it was getting harder and harder to find the time with how busy I was at work. Now I’m not working, and am still no closer to a degree, and realistically won’t be for at least another 3 years. How does one make a living in that time?

I keep vowing to obtain the skills to be a developer, a career path in which there is lots of work, but I can never muster the enthusiasm to follow through. I think I’m going to have to tell myself, “You’ll do it, or you’ll starve.” That certainly is a wake up call.
