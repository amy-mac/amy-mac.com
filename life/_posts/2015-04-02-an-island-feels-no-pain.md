Last June I lost a good friend whom I valued greatly due to an overprotective husband and miscommunication. Honestly I still haven’t gotten over it and dream about her still. I try to keep myself from thinking about the situation because it really upsets me but I can’t do anything about it but move on with my life.

Throughout the years and my moves all over the country I’ve lost a lot of friends and most of the time it’s the ones I was closest to, which seems unfair. Sometimes I fought for them and sometimes we’d part ways cold turkey and that was that. A lot were unhealthy relationships, some weren’t, but I’ve ended up with few friends that have been long-term friends, and even fewer whom I’m really close to. When I first saw the kind of long-term awesome friendships my now husband has with his friends, I was envious and really felt that void in my life. I don’t have what he has.

Because of this fact though I take friendships pretty seriously and I don’t give them up easily. When I lost the aforementioned friend last year it really made me want to shut down and push other friends and acquaintances away, convinced this will just keep happening. Why try to get close to any more people when the ones I love the most are the ones that always leave, right?

I’ve been feeling that sentiment again lately. I’ve started questioning my current friendships, which ones are “real,” and wondering if I really should shut myself away and decrease my interactions with them, all because a single friend who I valued and previously respected has acted in a disappointing and offensive manner. A part of me wants to walk away from it, but we’re all human and make mistakes. I don’t really want to lose any more friends so I figure I should try to salvage this, right? I should talk to this person and tell them how I feel.

But this person no longer hears what I say, which has been part of the problem. They no longer seem to respect me as a person after 4 years of friendship and are really dismissive. They’re making assumptions instead of caring about the truth and  partly it’s been sexist behavior. So how do I fix it?

Mostly I’m trying to relieve myself of my inner turmoil rather than just being sad and keeping it bottled up, like I usually do. I miss blogging since it can be so therapeutic. It’d be nice if the answers magically presented themselves to me for once though.
