I have two separate things to say about birthdays.

1) People keep asking me what I'm doing for my birthday, or what I want to do for my birthday, and I really struggled with trying to come up with an answer. I simply can't think of anything to do. To be more specific, I cannot think of anything *special* to do. There are endless amounts of things that I enjoy doing with my time, and I tend to try to do these things on a regular basis. So trying to think of something fun to do that I haven't already been doing, is very difficult. I also guess I just don't enjoy doing the same kinds of things that other people enjoy doing. One coworker asked, "Why don't you go out to dinner then?" I said, "Well my fianc√© is cooking me dinner, and I really don't ever go out to eat." "Well now is your chance to go somewhere you've been wanting to go." "I can't think of a single place that I've been wanting to go out to eat." Others ask why I don't go out with friends, but whenever I try to organize events with more than one friend, no one comes, and then I feel shitty. Last year I did try to celebrate my birthday, for the first time in many years, and I invited about 30 "friends" and about half that said they'd definitely be there. I reserved tables at a karaoke place in advance and excitedly awaited the event. 2 hours into it, not a single friend had showed up and I was forced to give up the reserved tables. By the end of the night, about 5 friends had stopped in, but it was a complete failure as an outing.

So the thing about birthdays is that it isn't some special day of the year for me. I don't have more fun, I don't do things I don't normally do. What it comes down to is that I have fun all year long, and I do the things I want to do all year long. So I kind of think of my birthday the same way I do Valentine's day.

2) The other thing about birthdays. I tend to find them a little depressing. Being reminded of the passage of time, and your current age. It's not that I find being older depressing; it's more that I find the focus on age depressing, as well as stopping to think about how many years it's been since this or that, and realizing how fast it all passes by, or how things from the past can feel like another lifetime. I prefer not to think about the past, in general, but my birthdays make me start thinking about the past.

So as with many traditions that absolutely confuse me, I just don't understand the point of "celebrating my birthday." It is just another day, and most of my days are good.

That being said, my birthday this year has been an extra good day because I've been shown a lot of love by my fiance and my coworkers, and I've smiled and laughed more than a usual day. This was certainly the best birthday I've ever had. Thank you for those who wanted to make me feel special after I denounced my birthday to one and all. I've never had so many people wish me happy birthday, and give me so many gifts, and spread so much joy about the day of my birth.
