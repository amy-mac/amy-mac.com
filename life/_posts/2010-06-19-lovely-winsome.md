My little sister is one of the most amazing people I've met in my life. I went from one end of the United States all the way to the other to share the joy of her high school graduation. I wanted to be there when she walked through that door into the big scary world out there. Katie is pure and beautiful in ways I just don't see in anyone else. I hope the world doesn't tear that out of her. I wish I could stay by her side and protect her from all harm in the world but if we never knew pain, would we ever know happiness? I know she'll do amazing things. I'm already proud of the person she is and excited over the person she'll become.
