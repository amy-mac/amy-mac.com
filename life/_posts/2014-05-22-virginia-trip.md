During Jesse's Spring Break we took a trip to Virginia for a number of reasons. My little sister Katie graduated college this May and we weren't going to be able to go out there due to Jesse's teaching duties, but I still wanted to pay her a visit. Originally Jesse couldn't imagine why he'd ever want to go to Virginia, but when he found out that Monticello is in the very town that Katie goes to college, he became interested. The trip then evolved into one that would satisfy Jesse's history interests while I got to enjoy being in an area I loved, and used to live in, as well as see some of my good friends. I assured Jesse that the area was full of history but it wasn't until we were there that he connected geographically exactly where it was I had lived. Needless to say, he was pleased and excited.

##Day One
We left early on a Wednesday to arrive in Richmond, Virginia during the afternoon and drove from there to Charlottesville. After checking into our comfy AirBNB house, we rested and then headed to the University area to eat dinner. Jesse had his local beers, I had my local ciders, and we enjoyed hushpuppies (yay Southern food!). After dinner we walked over to Dunkin' Donuts/Baskin Robbins where we were going to meet up for ice cream with Katie and my other friend Wes who I hadn't seen in 4 years. I can't even describe how great it felt to hang out with both Wes and Katie even for a little bit that night. Love them so much.

##Day Two
We got up early to get to [Monticello](http://www.monticello.org/) right as it opened. 
We had a tour of the house scheduled first thing, so we didn't even eat breakfast first. 
It was a really beautiful day and everything around the estate was gorgeous. You're not allowed 
to take pictures inside of the house but we got plenty of the outside. We took our initial tour 
inside the house and that was pretty neat.

After getting some coffee and breakfast at the cafe we took the slave tour, which was especially 
fascinating (as well as sobering). Jesse loved that they didn't whitewash anything and didn't paint 
Thomas Jefferson as a saint. After the slave tour we went on the Garden tour and learned about 
TJ's interest in gardening. After about 6 hours of being there we had our fill and went back to the 
UVA campus to grab some lunch and hunt down Katie's acappella group. They were walking around singing 
to people and we got to hear a few songs, which was really great. Here is one of them for your viewing 
pleasure.

After that we left Katie to work on an essay while we went and napped and then we all went out to 
dinner at a restaurant downtown.

##Day Three
We had breakfast at Bodo's, where Katie told us we must absolutely eat and then headed out on the 
road to Newport News. We arrived much earlier in the day than I originally thought we would so 
we went to the [Mariner's Museum](http://www.marinersmuseum.org/), which I had been to once or 
twice when I lived in the area and thought Jesse would enjoy. As soon as he found out that there 
is a replica of the Monitor there he was anxious and excited about seeing it. It was at the 
museum that it fully dawned on him the historical significance of this geographical area. He 
then got much more excited about the area. We went to a barbecue place for dinner that night 
that I used to go to a lot called Smokey Bones.

##Day Four
We arrived at [Colonial Williamsburg](http://www.colonialwilliamsburg.com/) right after it opened. 
The weather was drizzly and a bit chilly but I assured Jesse that if you worried about rain 
no one would ever get anything done in Virginia. We opted to walk across the footbridge from the 
Visitor Center to Colonial Williamsburg and stopped at the plantation that is on the way. We chatted 
with the characters there for a little while before moving on. I was impressed with their devotion 
to authenticity in the way they run the farm there the way it would have been ran in the period. 
They build everything themselves and farm everything the way it would have been farmed. Jesse enjoyed 
that the characters will talk to you about the history and not just stay strictly in character. 
I started to tear up when we were talking to one of the gentlemen in a slave dwelling. I thought 
it'd be a miracle if I could go the whole day without crying.

There was a lot to see and do there and Jesse was really impressed with the largeness and quality
of it. He thought it was just going to be some tacky little themed place. After only an hour or so
there he thought he could easily spend the rest of our trip just there at Colonial Williamsburg. 
We certainly didn't get to see and do as much as we hoped with only one day there. We caught some of
the actors performing the way they would have in that era. We visited the Governer's mansion. We 
walked around town and got lunch at one of the taverns, which was really terrific and the atmosphere 
was very authentic. We visited the capitol and went into lots of shops. Jesse chatted with some of 
the local soldiers. I got an awesome new hat. Later in the night we went on a ghost tour that my 
friend Bill was leading. It was a really terrific day and we both had a great time.

##Day Five
I finally got to introduce Jesse to Cracker Barrel and he agreed with me that they're pretty great. 
Jesse obliged me by going to [Busch Gardens](http://seaworldparks.com/en/buschgardens-williamsburg/), 
which I assured him that he would enjoy because of the beauty, atmosphere, and shows, but once we 
arrived in the Park I discovered just how much he hates roller coasters which put a small damper on 
the day. It was the first time we had ever been to an amusement park together so I hadn't fully 
realized, otherwise I probably wouldn't have taken him. We made the most of it though and in the end
 he just waited for me while I went on some rollercoasters. He really enjoyed the celtic show in 
Ireland, which I knew he would, as well as the shows in Germany. After Busch we just went back
 to the hotel and relaxed.

##Day Six
On this morning we headed over to the [Jamestown Settlement](http://historyisfun.org/), the first 
permanent British colony in America. They teach you in elementary school all about the pilgrims that 
came to Plymouth Rock, but that was after this settlement, and they probably leave out Jamestown 
because it wasn't exactly a happy story. I find it fitting to know just how America, as we know it today,
 really got its start. A whole lot of starvation, murdering, death, and cannabilism, yay! It really
 is all fascinating though. I learned a lot about that era that I hadn't known before. We checked out
 the replica ships, the replica fort, and then spent a while going through the large museum in the
 visitor's center.

After getting some lunch we heading over to the actual Historic Jamestowne settlement, which is only
 about a mile or so from the replica. There's only one original structure still standing and that's the 
church tower, but you can see a lot of foundations outside the fort, from where it expanded, and the new
 fort walls are laid over the exact foundations of the old. They are also excavating and learning 
new things all the time about life in the fort. Really it is all kind of sad and sobering to think of 
what took place there 400 years ago.

We had reservations that night at the King's Tavern in Colonial Williamsburg but had some time to 
kill before that so we went and saw Oculus, which I found particularly terrifying because of my 
fear of mirrors. So it was definitely a worthwhile horror film. Dinner at King's Tavern was amazing. 
In authentic fashion, the only light came from the candles on the table so it was quite dark in the 
room we were dining. The menu had some pretty tasty (and expensive) things on it, but we were 
willing to splurge for the experience. We loved everything about it.

##Day Seven
This was somewhat of a free day. I had planned on going to Virginia Beach to lay out if it was 
warm enough. I thought it wasn't going to be, but it turned out that it was. However instead of 
laying out on the beach, we went to the Yorktown Battlefield where General Lord Cornwallis 
surrendered to General George Washington in a decisive victory that directly led to America 
winning its independence from Great Britain. There were French flags and French plaques there also
 since the French are directly responsible for helping us win, which modern America seems to forget. 
I had been to the beach there at Yorktown a couple times, but had never seen the historical aspects 
of it before. There's a nice big monument and the trenches on the battlefield are are still there. 
Jesse made me walk across the grass field of sharp stickers in my sandals towards the Redoubt that 
the French took, just so he could feel like he was storming it. What I do for love!

After we were done at Yorktown Battlefield we had had lunch at El Rancho's in Poquoson. It was a 
Mexican restaurant that I went to quite frequently when I lived in Poquoson. Then we headed down 
to Virginia Beach and Jesse got to experience the Atlantic Ocean on his feet for the (kind of) first
 time. I reminded him that he experienced the Atlantic when we were in Scotland, but he wanted 
to experience it on our continent. We walked up and down the beach, got some ice cream, and then
 went to Wannabe's Karaoke to meet up with friends. Wannabe's is one of my favorite Virginia 
karaoke spots. Unfortunately only two of my friends were able to make it out but we had an absolutely
 terrific time hanging out with Rico and Charity. Afterwards Jesse said he could see why I love
 them so much. He also said he could see why I hate karaoke in the Bay Area so much when compared
 with Virginia.

The next day we headed home and were greeted by some very happy kitties who missed us. It was such 
a great trip. To see all the photos that were taken, visit the
