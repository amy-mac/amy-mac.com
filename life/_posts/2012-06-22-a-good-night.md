Tonight is unreal, and a reminder that once in a while I do catch a break. Sitting at the opera in seats I will never in my lifetime be able to afford, receiving a special backstage tour which was awe-inspiring, and being able to share it with a partner who loves both me and opera = about as good as it can get.
