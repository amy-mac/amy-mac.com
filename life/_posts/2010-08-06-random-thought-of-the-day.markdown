I always look at the things I want to pass onto my children and the talents that I have to offer them and think that my children are going to think I'm really neat, but today it occurred to me that as someone who grew up without parents and therefore nothing to think was really neat about my parents, do children really think that way, or do they just take it for granted? Is my child going to not care or value the fact that I'm an artist, or that I sing, dance, and perform? Will they shrug that I play piano for them, or that I pass on to them a crazy amount of books to fuel their knowledge and curiosity of life?

I guess what it comes down to is that I think these are all great things, but not everyone would. Some people frown on artists, books are going extinct, and my children might just think actors are weird. I can try to raise them to have an appreciation of all the things that I appreciate but they'll have their own personalities and interests. Is it stupid to suddenly worry that my children won't think I'm as artistically amazing as I want them to? I guess what I'm really trying to say is that I want them to be proud of me. If I had a mother who played piano it would be one of my fondest memories to have listened to her growing up. Instead I have those memories with other people playing piano, etc. I mean, and really *insert any instrument here*. It's funny that I don't care what other people think of my personality and so called achievements, but it means so much to me to be able to give my being to my children and for them to be grateful.

I guess only time will tell. Who knows if I'll ever get to have children, right?
