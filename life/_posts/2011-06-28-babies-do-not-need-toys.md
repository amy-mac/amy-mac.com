<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/25700271">Babies do not need toys</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user7334294">Amy Sloan</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

I am endlessly fascinated when watching babies explore and figure out the world. I am also quite entertained by the fact that theyâ€™d rather play with something simple than any of the fancy toys we tend to shower them with. My shoes kept my 14 month old nephew occupied for about 30 minutes.
