**Big announcement that is both happy and sad**

Although we had hoped to live in Alameda the rest our lives...we are moving after 8 years of living in this wonderful town. When we first moved to Alameda housing was more affordable but we have moved 4 times as our family grew and watched the rents get higher and higher, and houses for sale have doubled in price during that time as well.

As many of you know we’ve been house hunting because of the right amount of luck giving us a window of opportunity and we have many frustrations with the place we’ve been renting for the last 3 years. We thought just maybe we could afford a tiny house or condo in Alameda but we kept getting outbid by a lot. So we started looking in Oakland where houses are bigger, cheaper, and my commute to San Francisco would stay mostly the same.

It almost seems absurd because of why I left Oakland originally; I thought I’d never go back. But we’ve bought a house! We found a place we can call our own and have high hopes that we can make it work. Hopefully this time will be different than before and hopefully friends and family will visit us. Also it’s close enough to Alameda that we can still do things there. We're all very excited about the house but we also feel very sad about leaving Alameda. We were conflicted during this whole process. No more walking to the beach or just crossing the street for dance class, or really walking to anything in general. No more corner market lady who has watched both my babies grow and includes Hershey’s kisses for them with every purchase. No more taking the ferry to work, and no more small town feel.

But we’ll have a backyard for the kids to play in, and we’ll have a garden like they have always wanted. We won’t be lining up to fight over the single toilet; we won't have to freeze in the winter while we pay our downstairs neighbor's high electric bills; we won’t have to deal with tunnel traffic every day. And my children will have something stable and secure like I never did. My childhood was spent in motels, tiny apartments, and living with friends; I never thought owning my own home would be possible.

So this is the next big adventure for us and we're feeling all the things. We are moving to our new home the last weekend in August and the kids are happy they won’t be dragged to any more open houses after 4 months of it. Ada has already started kindergarten at a school in Oakland and loves it; the girls already made friends with the new neighborhood cats, and they've made one neighborhood friend. Right now we're busy de-cluttering and packing, but we'll be sure to share some pictures and more details soon.

Also shout out and thank you to those who have provided advice, recommendations, and guidance through this whole process.
