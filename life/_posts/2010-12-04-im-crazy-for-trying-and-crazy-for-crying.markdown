Someday I want to know what it feels like to have someone be crazy about me, or does that really only happen in the movies? I know things are always better in the books and in the movies, but can't it be possible for someone to adore me? I've adored other people but never had it returned.

Is it really just me? I used to think I was quirky and abnormal but the more I see of the world the more I realize that I'm really not that unique. Is that it? I'm not special enough for anyone to be crazy about? I hide away in my little world learning and studying everything but how to interact with other human beings. No...actually I even study that sometimes, but can never find living beings to test out my newfound knowledge on. "Not enough field research," that's what Asa used to tell me.

I guess deep down I'm just like everyone else. I want to be understood and I want to be loved. I want someone to think about me all the time, to yearn for me, and to not be able to get enough of me, and I'm not talking physical passion, though that would be nice too. People have lusted after me before, but no ones ever been crazy about me as a person. I want someone to be delighted in all the new things they learn about me, to smile with the pure joy of hanging out with me, to be enthusiastic about all the possibilities of life that can only be achieved through the synergy of our two beings.

And that's all idealistic bullshit, I know.

Maybe I just want someone who'll return my calls. But I always want too much.
