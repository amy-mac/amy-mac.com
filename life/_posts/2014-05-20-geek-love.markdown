I had almost forgotten to share this mini review of Geek Love. I finished it a while ago.

##_Geek Love_ by Katherine Dunn

This definitely had me hooked on the story right away, but at the same time there was a bit of discomfort for me at first, due to some of the subject matter. I have a very vivid imagination and sometimes when someone so much as mentions something it immediately pops into my head with full imagery. While I know fully well what geeks were back in circus days, it nonetheless bothered me to think of animals being hurt as thatâ€™s a major sensitivity of mine, so when they talked in detail about the geeks at the beginning of the book I had to try very hard not to think about it too much.

Aside from that I thoroughly enjoyed the entire book and found it to be intriguing, leaving me constantly wondering where it was going to go next. I don't think I have any complaints about it and would recommend it to anyone who likes a little something out of the ordinary.
