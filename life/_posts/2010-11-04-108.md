I was cast in _Dirty Rotten Scoundrels_ as Featured Dancer/Ensemble. When rehearsals start I will find out whether I was cast in the role I read for at callbacks. I really hope I am, as it will allow me to put a french accent to use and then I can say that my french classes in school weren't worthless. I think doing a show will be really good for me right now. It'll keep me busy and active, and who knows, maybe I'll make some friends.

I'm thinking about taking some creative writing classes and get back into writing. We'll see how that goes. It'll probably be a while until I pursue that, as finances are a little low lately.

I've had [Stars and the Moon](http://www.jasonrobertbrown.com/theatre/songs/lyrics.php?songID=songs06) from _Songs for a New World_ stuck in my head lately. I think it's because of my own inner fears right now that "I'll never have the moon." It's one of those painfully beautiful songs. Well I guess most of the songs in _Songs for a New World_ are bittersweet.
