    <p>This was my final project for GA and is a project built
      for a client who has had this web app idea for a long time. It aims to help ease the process of flowing a debate round for both tournament judges
      and the teams participating. It was my first full-fledged project
      using Backbone.js and is primarily front-end work with a Rails back-end. I actively work on this and recently converted it from CoffeeScript to JavaScript because I like the latter better.</p>

    <p><small>Ruby | Rails | JS/jQuery | HTML5 | CSS3</small></p>
    <p>This was a group project built by 4 people. It is a map-based
      website that helps cyclists find safer routes. It crowdsources
      hazards to show where construction, potholes, etc may hinder riding
      and also shows information about where cyclist-related accidents have
      taken place. Cyclists can put in their route to see just how many of
      these hazards are on their normal route and make adjustments. It makes
       use of the Google Maps API. My primary responsibility was handling most of the JavaScript in the project, but I also took part in every other aspect.</p>

    <p>This is a site to help people find the best beaches around their
      house for spontaneous beach trips. It very quickly shows the current
      weather and live traffic time for the beaches to help people make
      a decision faster and get out the door. It makes use of the Yelp API,
      Mapquest API, and Weather Underground API.</p>
