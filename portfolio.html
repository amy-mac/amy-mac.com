    <p>This was my final project for GA and was a project built 
      for a client who had this app idea for a year now. It aims to help 
      ease the process of flowing a debate round for both tournament judges 
      and the teams participating. It was my first full-fledged project 
      using Backbone.js and is very front-end heavy with a Rails back-end.</p>

    <h4 class="subheader">Project Details</h4>
    <p>Ruby | Rails | JS/jQuery | HTML5 | CSS3</p>
    <p>This was a group project built by 4 people. It is a map-based 
      website that helps cyclists find safer routes. It crowdsources 
      hazards to show where construction, potholes, etc may hinder riding 
      and also shows information about where cyclist-related accidents have 
      taken place. Cyclists can put in their route to see just how many of 
      these hazards are on their normal route and make adjustments. It makes
       use of the Google Maps API.</p>
    <p><em>This site is in its alpha stage and will continue to be built 
      out for extra functionality and better user experience.</em></p>

    <p>This is a site to help people find the best beaches around their 
      house for spontaneous beach trips. It very quickly shows the current 
      weather and live traffic time for the top beaches to help people make 
      a decision faster and get out the door. It makes use of the Yelp API, 
      Mapquest API, and Weather Underground API.</p>
