Sitting here I suddenly thought, "I wish I had some crayons..." and then immediately thought in reply, "This from the girl who has every other kind of medium imaginable leftover from art school," as my mind took stock of the mass amounts of paint, color pencils, pastels, etc. at my disposal.

I realized that this was a fitting metaphor of my life. No matter what I have I'm never satisfied; there's always something else I want. I'm not actually a very materialistic person, it's not like I just want stuff, or that I care for riches, or always need the best big thing. I think part of the problem is that dreaming is better than the attainment. I could sit down and draw with some color pencils but no, I want crayons. There are at least 15 books in my house that I haven't read but right now in this instant I want to read one that I don't own yet. I could watch 100 different movies in my Netflix queue, movies that I wanted very much to see when they were in theaters, but don't seem as interesting right now as the ones that are in the theater currently.

Really, it's hard to find contentment or satisfaction in anything at all in my current state. When I set my hopes on one thing that I really want then nothing else can keep my focus, and if I can't have it then the things that would normally keep me happy and occupied do neither of those things.

Will I never be satisfied in life? Will there always be something gnawing at me? Was I a gypsy in another life, cursed to be eternally restless? I guess I can't delude myself anymore that I'm okay with being alone all the time. When I think of my happiest times in life, they were always when I had close confidantes and people with whom to share life's treasures. But what do I do? I've tried to make friends here in the Bay Area, and start a new life, but it's all proving much harder than it was in Virginia. Rehearsals start in earnest on Monday and I know I'll feel better once they start, but what happens after this show ends? Or what if it ends up the same as in _The Producers_ when I felt like an outcast and just wanted the show to be over?

I don't know the answers, I never have, but to quote the Counting Crows, "Today was just a day fading into another and that can't be what a life is for."
