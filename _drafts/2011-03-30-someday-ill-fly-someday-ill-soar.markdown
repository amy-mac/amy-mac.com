For those who may have not seen the retweet, here is a [link to the video](http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=208574029169408&oid=152315315683&comments) I made for the 2011 Aspen Winter Games Awards Ceremony. It's kind of a wrap-up of the week, and therefore it gets made very quickly at the end, so I'm never fully satisfied with it, but other people are, so maybe I'm just too hard on myself.

I'm starting to think that I'm letting fear prevent me from pursuing the things that I really want to pursue. I have some good reasons for applying for office jobs at tech startups, but I realized yesterday that more than anything that's what's "easy" and comfortable for me. I'm going to work harder to attempt to do the artsy things I really want to do. I just never seem to know where to start. On the bright side I least I have the artsy jobs I get on the side from my long-term loyal clients. I really am looking forward to editing the souvenir video for Winter Games. I'll be getting a start on that soon :-)
