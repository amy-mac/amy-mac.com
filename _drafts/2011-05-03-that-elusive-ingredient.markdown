I’ve reached a point in my life where I know very much want I want but I am struggling to find and obtain it. It’s frustrating and sometimes makes me start to despair. I am just hoping that once I do get my hands on it that it really does make life just that much better. Here’s to hoping and continuing the pursuit.

**Update**: It’s occurred to me that posting things in the middle of the night is almost like drunk posting. This morning I was closing apps on my iPhone and saw that Tumblr had been open and had a moment of panic wondering what I posted.
