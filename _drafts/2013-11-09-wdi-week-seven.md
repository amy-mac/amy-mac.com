Intro
<h2>Monday</h2>
I was feeling much more motivated than the prior week and ready to jump back in and learn as much as possible.
<h2>Friday</h2>
For the first half of the day everyone was continuing to work on the lab project from the day before. I had a very frustrating and unproductive morning due to not understanding the way form_for builds worked.

After lunch we got together with our groups and started project planning.
