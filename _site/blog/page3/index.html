      <p>Yesterday was the first day of class. I arrived out of breath and sweaty from my exertions of trying not be late on the first day. Normally this would not be an issue but for some reason all three public transit methods from Alameda were backed up today. It’s the first time ever that I’ve seen the parking lot at the ferry terminal in Alameda completely full.I was nervous about the first day, not knowing what to expect, and worrying that I’d be lost. This wasn’t the case, and I was actually bored most of the day. I think I would have actually preferred the former, but the instructors have assured us that day 2 is going to move at a much faster pace. I was mainly concerned because everything they went over on Day 1 was easy stuff from the pre-work that everyone already knew, and yet the Camel class was way ahead of us.</p>

      <p>Tonight we had the orientation and installfest for WDI. It was really great to finally put some faces to the names I’ve been seeing on the contact sheet for the last couple of weeks. I was especially excited to see our instructors and learn more about them. We were separated into two groups and I was put into the Snakes Brigade (which makes me think of the House of Slytherin). I was a little disappointed because all the people I had already befriended were put into the Camel group, but I’m sure once I get to know everyone in my group, I’ll be just as happy. I mean one student in my group had a Totoro decal on her laptop so she’s already my new favorite <a href="http://person.At">person.At</a> the beginning of the orientation the producer, Annie, congratulated us all on getting into the program. She said that they made the admissions harder in between the last cohort and this one, and that this was the most selective they’d been so far. That definitely gave me a little boost. There are also a lot of students that aren’t from the Bay Area, including a couple Europeans, which is pretty neat.</p>

      <p>I am a member of the SF Ruby Meet Up group. Today I checked my email and saw a message thread from the group that made me feel sick to my stomach. A woman had sent a message to the group saying that she was looking for women developers for an internship and those interested should email her. The first couple replies were very reasonable ones from men giving her a heads up that it is illegal to discriminate based on gender, and that they would recommend not listing genders in job postings. These replies weren’t attacking her, they were factual, and she immediately sent a reply apologizing for the mistake and welcomed those of all genders to apply. Everything’s cool then, right?It’s all the messages after that one that sickened me. A ton of replies from men attacking her for discriminating against men, saying that she was going to just discriminate in secret now, and that she’d choose a female over “the more qualified candidate.” They even pointed out that most of the group is men. She tried yet another apology but they just rolled on over her. Some of them tried to act like they were just being funny but none of it felt funny.</p>

      <p>A lot of my closest friends have been following along on my private Twitter account with my career journey this year, but I can finally talk about it a bit more publicly. In February I decided that it was time to start pursuing my passions again and get back to working on my career in tech. My goal since December of 2011 has been to be a professional front-end web developer instead of just a hobbyist front-end web developer. To that end I spent a couple months of my unemployment trying to advance my skills at home independently. HTML and CSS have been in the bag since I was a teenager but I knew I needed to finally learn JavaScript and JQuery and build up a portfolio. Unfortunately, this wasn’t progressing as quickly as I had hoped, as the resources I was using to learn weren’t very great. In addition, I really needed a source of income, so I was spending a lot of time applying to anything I could find in order to pay the bills. After 5 months of unemployment I eventually got a job as an Office Manager at Viator, Inc and my career goals were put on hold.Which brings us back to February of this year. I set some firm deadlines for myself and started spending my evenings and weekends doing tutorials online. I also started working on hand-coding a new website for myself (for the 10th time in the last year) to better represent myself. I was devouring every resource I could find on front-end development. I joined a bunch of meetup groups, some skillshare classes on JavaScript, general programming, and took a one month Ruby on Rails class on a whim (which produced <a href="http://obscure-tor-8051.herokuapp.com/">this</a>). I also did a pricey one-day workshop about iOS programming (which I was very dissatisfied with, by the way) because I was just so anxious to start learning everything about everything as fast as I could. I was advancing much more quickly then I was before, but I was really scattered trying to learn a billion of things at once instead of just focusing on one thing at a time. But through all these different resources I discovered something that didn’t exist back when I was working towards this goal while unemployed: web development bootcamps.</p>

      <p>One of the things that I value in the workplace is efficiency. At every company I’ve worked for I’ve delighted in discovering and implementing more efficient methods of carrying out tasks. Being that I’m often the most tech savvy person at a lot of the companies I’ve worked for, I’ve strived to help them adopt newer technologies and methods of running more efficiently, whenever I’m in a position to do so. The managing teams are often very enthusiastic about this, sometimes I’m even part of the managing team, but I’ve sometimes found it very hard to get employees to accept and adopt newer technologies and/or newer methods. This serves as a great frustration for me; when I’ve spent a lot of time and effort trying to make things better for other people and they just dismiss it.Some might say, “Well everyone has a different way of doing things and the methods you institute may not work best for everyone,” and that is true, but many of the technologies I have shown people are an undeniable asset. For example, the person who needs to re-size 100 pictures in Photoshop, in order to upload them somewhere on the internet (which they most likely even know how to do because I taught them), and says that it’ll take forever. I personally just use automation for this task, but many people do not know how to do this. So I provide them with some easy free software that’s sole purpose is to do this very task for them. You just give it the pictures and it spits them back out at the setting you ask for, but then they just end up not using it and either continue to complain that the task will take forever, or they just neglect to do the task at all. This type of example is an issue I’ve run into a lot. I’ve also run into the issue of people flat out not caring about being more efficient with their work, or having easier ways to accomplish tasks. As long as they are getting their paycheck they’re fine with the status quo; they’re fine with tasks being harder than they have to be.<!-- more --></p>
