      <p>I live on the island of Alameda in the San Francisco Bay area. We are bordered on our east side by the Oakland Coliseum and our west side by AT&amp;T Park just directly across the water 3 miles away. When there are fireworks in either of these places we can hear them, and sometimes see them. On holidays we hear all the surrounding fireworks. We also get Blue Angels flying over and so on.<figure>

      <p>It’s been way too long since I’ve written a post on this particular blog, so what better occasion than to announce that after 3 1/2 years I have left my job at Coupa Software. My last day was on August 18th and I will certainly miss the friends I made there, but it was definitely time for a <a href="http://change.So">change.So</a> one week ago I started my new role at <a href="http://www.glassbreakers.co">Glassbreakers</a>, which is a much smaller company and located closer to home. I am very excited about this new adventure and looking forward to the future. I also am excited that my new job will allow me to have a much better work/life balance so that I’ll get more time with my kids and actually have time for my passion projects. Looking forward to talking more about those soon.</p>

      <p>Lately I’ve been reading a whole lot about drag and drop while I’ve tried to implement a ‘drag from desktop to upload’ feature. While some of these features have been around for a very long time, others are new and therefore finicky.One of the annoying things about dragging files from the desktop is that there are only 3 events that the browser will recognize for this target: <code>dragenter</code>, <code>dragover</code>, and <code>drop</code>; whereas when you drag items that are already in the browser you also have <code>dragstart</code>, <code>drag</code>, and <code>dragend</code>. I read a lot of articles telling you that you <strong>can’t</strong> do these things, but I wasn’t satisfied with that. I knew there had to be a way to cheat. There are in fact a couple ways that you can fake the drag start and drag end events. Here are the tricks:</p>

      <p>I’ve been promising to write a wrap-up post about General Assembly and have continued to receive requests asking about what my experience was like and if I think it’s worth it. Now that it’s been almost 3 months since the program ended, I feel I can do a better job of wrapping it all <a href="http://up.To">up.To</a> start with, if you’re someone who hasn’t read my Bootcamp Application Journey post, I’ll reiterate the point that General Assembly was the very last on my list of preferred bootcamps. I went there because I didn’t get accepted into any of my top choices and couldn’t afford Hack Reactor (though I likely wouldn’t have been accepted to Hack Reactor either). Information was so scarce on General Assembly that I questioned whether I might be better off just staying home to study on my own rather than spend the money, but I figured that I’d at least have the benefit of having the instructors to help me get unstuck when needed or to provide guidance. What also ended up convincing me to attend was their <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/apprentice">apprenticeship program</a>, which I figured was a good worst-case scenario that I’d have no problem getting into.</p>

      <p>I recently started giving myself a crash course in <a href="http://emberjs.com" title="Ember.js">Ember.js</a> to do a quick example app for a job interview. I was pretty sure I could pick it up quickly since once thing I definitely learned in the bootcamp was how to learn fast and work quickly. This certainly isn’t ideal for most real world situations because you want to produce high quality sites and apps which require proper planning, testing, and attention to detail. But it’s nice to know what I am capable of doing in a pinch.One of the things that is really starting to amaze me is that the more I learn about all these different technologies the less scary everything looks, as a whole. When I look at new languages, they don’t look like Greek and I can generally get the gist of what they’re doing. It’s also the same with JavaScript frameworks, though I’m really only on my 2nd right now. After about 8 hours of working with Ember.js it reminds me so much of Rails with its naming conventions and automated “magic.” I can see how Backbone.js gives you so much more liberty, which is nice, but Ember.js makes specific things quicker and easier because of the conventions. An example is when you’re looping over a collection in its template, you don’t have to specify the variables for what you’re looping over because it knows that you’re probably going to want to loop over the collection of objects that are associated with that template and controller.</p>

      <p>I finally finished liberating my blog from Wordpress’ clutches a few days ago and getting it set up with Jekyll instead. It feels really great to have so much more control over it and to have it also be more lightweight.After getting it set up with my current website design, I started preparing it for uploading and realized it didn’t make sense to keep the files separate from the main part of my website and decided to translate my webpages into the Jekyll format as well. This actually has also been such a relief organizationally because I’ve gotten spoiled by templates in all my web app work and can now set up templates easier for my own simple and static site. I still have a lot of work to do in fine-tuning it and adding features to the blog but it’s a nice start and I’m really excited to work on it more.</p>
