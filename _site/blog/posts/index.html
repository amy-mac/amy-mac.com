We are bordered on our east side by the Oakland Coliseum and our west side by AT&amp;T Park just directly across the water 3 miles away. When there are fireworks in either of these places we can hear them, and sometimes see them. On holidays we hear all the surrounding fireworks. We also get Blue Angels flying over and so on.</p>

      <p>I recently started giving myself a crash course in <a href="http://emberjs.com" title="Ember.js">Ember.js</a> to do a quick example app for a job interview. I was pretty sure I could pick it up quickly since once thing I definitely learned in the bootcamp was how to learn fast and work quickly. This certainly isn’t ideal for most real world situations because you want to produce high quality sites and apps which require proper planning, testing, and attention to detail. But it’s nice to know what I am capable of doing in a pinch.</p>

<p>The final project that I created in WDI was an app that had been on my mind for quite a few months because it was an app that my husband, Jesse, had been wanting someone to build since February 2013. He is an assistant debate coach and spends most of his weekends during the school year at Debate Tournaments. There is a particular way that both the judges and the teams track debate rounds and they are referred to as flows. A textbook shows an example of a flow as this:</p>

      <p>There are two reasons that I stopped posting blog entries after the 6th week of WDI. The main reason is that I’ve simply been too busy. During the 7th week I was so busy on the 2nd project, which was a group project, and after that it just continued to stay busy; every spare minute I was either working on homework, projects, or studying. I even started to feel behind when I let myself go out a couple times. It’s no joke, you cannot try to have a social life while doing a bootcamp.</p>

      <p>It really does feel like these weeks are just blowing by so quickly. Over the weekend I stumbled across some shortcuts in TextMate that I didn’t realize existed and made me love the software even more. The first couple days of the week were very mini-project based, which was nice. I said to my husband Tuesday night, “I’ve made 3 basic web apps this week…and it’s only Tuesday.” It’s really nice to have things like that to show the progress we’re making. First business of the week was that they mixed up the Camels and the Snakes, because when they polled us they found that we wanted more interaction with the other students. So I had to switch into the Camel classroom, which I like a lot better because there’s no glare on my glossy computer screen causing me extreme difficulty all day.</p>

      <p>Yesterday was the first day of class. I arrived out of breath and sweaty from my exertions of trying not be late on the first day. Normally this would not be an issue but for some reason all three public transit methods from Alameda were backed up today. It’s the first time ever that I’ve seen the parking lot at the ferry terminal in Alameda completely full.</p>

      <p>Tonight we had the orientation and installfest for WDI. It was really great to finally put some faces to the names I’ve been seeing on the contact sheet for the last couple of weeks. I was especially excited to see our instructors and learn more about them. We were separated into two groups and I was put into the Snakes Brigade (which makes me think of the House of Slytherin). I was a little disappointed because all the people I had already befriended were put into the Camel group, but I’m sure once I get to know everyone in my group, I’ll be just as happy. I mean one student in my group had a Totoro decal on her laptop so she’s already my new favorite person.</p>

      <p>I am a member of the SF Ruby Meet Up group. Today I checked my email and saw a message thread from the group that made me feel sick to my stomach. A woman had sent a message to the group saying that she was looking for women developers for an internship and those interested should email her. The first couple replies were very reasonable ones from men giving her a heads up that it is illegal to discriminate based on gender, and that they would recommend not listing genders in job postings. These replies weren’t attacking her, they were factual, and she immediately sent a reply apologizing for the mistake and welcomed those of all genders to apply. Everything’s cool then, right?</p>

      <p>A lot of my closest friends have been following along on my private Twitter account with my career journey this year, but I can finally talk about it a bit more publicly. In February I decided that it was time to start pursuing my passions again and get back to working on my career in tech. My goal since December of 2011 has been to be a professional front-end web developer instead of just a hobbyist front-end web developer. To that end I spent a couple months of my unemployment trying to advance my skills at home independently. HTML and CSS have been in the bag since I was a teenager but I knew I needed to finally learn JavaScript and JQuery and build up a portfolio. Unfortunately, this wasn’t progressing as quickly as I had hoped, as the resources I was using to learn weren’t very great. In addition, I really needed a source of income, so I was spending a lot of time applying to anything I could find in order to pay the bills. After 5 months of unemployment I eventually got a job as an Office Manager at Viator, Inc and my career goals were put on hold.</p>

      <p>One of the things that I value in the workplace is efficiency. At every company I’ve worked for I’ve delighted in discovering and implementing more efficient methods of carrying out tasks. Being that I’m often the most tech savvy person at a lot of the companies I’ve worked for, I’ve strived to help them adopt newer technologies and methods of running more efficiently, whenever I’m in a position to do so. The managing teams are often very enthusiastic about this, sometimes I’m even part of the managing team, but I’ve sometimes found it very hard to get employees to accept and adopt newer technologies and/or newer methods. This serves as a great frustration for me; when I’ve spent a lot of time and effort trying to make things better for other people and they just dismiss it.</p>

Indeed, it may be the most difficult task in the world, for opening the door to your own life is, in the end, more difficult than opening the doors to the mysteries of the universe.

      <p>It’s recently become very clear to me that the biggest immediate goal in my life right now is to get hired by a fun tech startup in the city. The search is both exciting and nerve-wrecking, much akin to dating. “Oh my gosh, what if no one wants me?” But like love, I’m sure that when it does fit for both the company and me, it will be glorious.</p>

      <p>I’ve spent most of the last week up to my elbows in fixing computers, setting up computers, and general technology. It should be enough to make someone’s head explode. I sometimes think, “What would we do without it?” and yet I am the last generation that can remember what it was like without it. We get so used to habits though I can understand how we get so lazy. The other day I was going to ask a friend to give me his address before I stopped having a printer so I could print out directions from mapquest because how in the world would I find it otherwise and then I thought, “No, you’ll do it the old fashioned way and you’ll deal with it!” as memories of friends giving extensive directions about “turn left on this street, go 5 blocks…” flooded my brain.</p>
