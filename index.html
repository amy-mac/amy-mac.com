<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings! My name is Amy MacKinnon and I&rsquo;m a web developer, thespian, and mother.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, but have also lived in Idaho, Colorado, and Virginia before returning home. I&rsquo;ve worked in a few different fields and as <abbr title="Xena: Warrior Princess">Xena</abbr> would say, &ldquo;I have many skills.&rdquo; My greatest passion in life is theatre, followed by computers &amp; technology. I have two young daughters who take up most of my free time but I still make time to pursue my interests.</p>

<p>Those interests and hobbies include: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amy_sloan/sets/72157626611783178/">baking pies</a>, cosplaying, gardening, cuddling with my cats, reading books and comics, crocheting/knitting, playing board games and video games, <a href="/theatre">performing theatre</a>, seeing theatre, playing piano, tap dancing, and more. I'm extremely fascinated by just about everything out there in the world. This website highlights only a small part of my adventures.</p>
