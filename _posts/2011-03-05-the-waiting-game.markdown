It is really hard to be patient when you're working to move your life forward and you feel like you're at a standstill waiting for so many different things. I'm waiting to hear back about jobs, waiting to find a place with my new roommate, waiting for all the things that are going to stem from those two things. I've never been a person who's good at sitting still, and I'm getting very restless but trying to remind myself to be patient today. Good things are on the horizon. I just have to get through a few more weeks of the current status first.
