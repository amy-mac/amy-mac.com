[Consensus is for Losers](http://www.dkeithrobinson.com/features/entry/consensus_is_for_losers/)

This is a great blog entry from Keith Robinson that states many things that I have tried to hammer into the heads of people I have worked with on designs.


> "You simply cannot have a strong design if you have to please too many people."

The funny thing is that there seems to be a consensus (haha) among designers that this is the case, so my question is: why are we still having to fight people on this? Also, even worse than design committees are non-designers thinking they know best, which results in this: [How a Web Design Goes Straight to Hell](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell). The latter subject being what I deal with the most. I know we've all been there, and I'm probably preaching to the choir, but I sometimes think, "Why do I even bother?" So often I end up in frustration because of watching people argue back and forth about how I should design something, and wondering why they hired me in the first place when they act like they're the experts and I know nothing. However, I guess I should take Keith's advice, "Argue with your clients if you feel strongly theyâ€™re not doing what is in their best interests."
