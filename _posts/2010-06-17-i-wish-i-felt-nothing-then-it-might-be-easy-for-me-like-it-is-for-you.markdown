After turning the shower off I crouched on the bathtub floor immobilized. Like so many times in my life I was physically unable to leave the safety and quiet of the bathtub for the harsh turmoil of the real world.

I've discovered that someone who was my best friend for over a year is incapable of emotion. He can't feel love, or heartbreak; I am envious. I've realized I don't know him and am mourning a lie. It doesn't make the hurting go away.

Is there any truth left in the world?
