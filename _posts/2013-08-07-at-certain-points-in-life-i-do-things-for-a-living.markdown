I'm starting to find that my life's journey of starting out as a hobbyist front-end coder to aspiring theatre actress to aspiring English major to Director of Operations at a non-profit organization to professional print designer to Computer Arts student to aspiring video editor to transitional user interface designer to project coordinator to aspiring professional front-end developer to aspiring full-stack web developer is actually a pretty common kind of transition.

Also...I have many skills.

I find myself reminded of this monologue from Working the musical. It's always really resonated for me. Jobs are not big enough for people.
