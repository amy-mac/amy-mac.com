I'm starting to realize that the older I get, the less likely it is that I will find someone worthwhile to share my life with, because they will already be taken by other people. I wish I could go back to not caring about relationships or wanting one, but I've realized how much more rewarding and amazing life can be with one. I don't want to have a child alone anymore; I want to share that experience with someone else. Everyone always says don't settle, and I haven't since my first relationship, but that means I may be alone forever. Maybe it's less important to find someone I can love, than it is to find someone who'll love me. I suppose I should start by leaving my house, right? /smirk

I am going to start applying for new jobs in just another month and I've been hard at work updating my resumes, and preparing for that time. I've really got my hopes up to find an awesome new job, hopefully related to technology or art in some capacity, and with good benefits. I don't think I have my sights set too high because there's really a lot of that in this area. I think a lot of things will fall into place after that. If all goes well I'll move right into the city, I'll be making friends at work, and who knows, maybe someone will ask me on a date in real life (for the first time ever). It could happen!

Working on the Disney World plans. Unfortunately I don't think I'm going to be able to find availability for when my cousin goes, which means I'll be going alone but that's okay because I have a friend who works there! :-) I'm really excited about it, and wish I could take the vacation sooner.
