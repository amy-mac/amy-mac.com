The other night I was at a dinner party where they had 90's music playing through Pandora. I was loving the music, because I love reliving the 90's on a regular basis, and a song came on that I don't think I've heard in many years. I was sitting there subconsciously singing along—I knew every word—and that's when it hit me that I hadn't heard it in so long. I had to think about what the name of the song was and then I wondered _why_ I hadn't heard it in so long, because darnit I love this song. I had it on a cassette tape and that was how I used to listen to it so much. I can't listen to my cassette tapes anymore because my biological mother stole my last CD/Tape player 9 years ago. 9 years I haven't been able to listen to my cassette tapes, but I still have them.

Now I add music on Rdio and listen to it there, but sometimes there are songs like that one that get forgotten about, so they can't be added, and I think that's sad. So I'm probably going to listen to "Wrong Way" by Sublime about 20 times in the next week to make up for lost time.
