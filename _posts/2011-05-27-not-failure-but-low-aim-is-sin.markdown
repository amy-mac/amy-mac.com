[swissmiss | Not Failure, but Low Aim is Sin](http://www.swiss-miss.com/2011/05/not-failure-but-low-aim-is-sin.html).

I always feel better about my life when I have goals that I'm working towards, and when I am dreaming of good things, however unrealistic. Sometimes I start to despair, and sometimes I think of just giving up because it's never going to happen anyway, but then I think to myself, **"Try harder."**
