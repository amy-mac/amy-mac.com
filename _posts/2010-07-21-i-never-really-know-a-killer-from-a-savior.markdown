Today is one of those days of a million thoughts, reflections, and analyzations. The inner voice springs up to input its two cents, which are usually reprimands about my character. I'm usually the first to admit that I'm too proud, I'm a snob, and I react too quickly to everything, but today the inner voice chimed in with, "What's wrong with you?" and then I felt bad and guilty. I don't know what's really wrong with me. I instinctually go on the defense but then back away and realize there was never an attack.

I don't understand people. I've tried to for a long time but I really don't think I've ever made any progress. People confuse me profusely. I've always been different, in ways both good and bad. There's only ever been a couple people who could handle me as a whole, accept it, and love it completely. I keep hoping that more of those people will come along so that I won't have to deal with all the other people out there, but I don't know. Maybe that's wishful thinking. Maybe it's time I learn to play nice with civilization. I'm so unskilled at interacting with other people and I can't blame that on a lack of practice anymore. I'm going to have to learn, and that's that.

I just wish I knew the correct times to be strong and proud, and the times to give in and be humble, because I never seem to choose right.
