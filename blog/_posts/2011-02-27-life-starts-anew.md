It's recently become very clear to me that the biggest immediate goal in my life right now is to get hired by a fun tech startup in the city. The search is both exciting and nerve-wrecking, much akin to dating. "Oh my gosh, what if no one wants me?" But like love, I'm sure that when it does fit for both the company and me, it will be glorious.

So many exciting things on the horizon and I've got a smile on my face!
