It's been way too long since I've written a post on this particular blog, so what better occasion than to announce that after 3 1/2 years I have left my job at Coupa Software. My last day was on August 18th and I will certainly miss the friends I made there, but it was definitely time for a change.

So one week ago I started my new role at [Glassbreakers](http://www.glassbreakers.co), which is a much smaller company and located closer to home. I am very excited about this new adventure and looking forward to the future. I also am excited that my new job will allow me to have a much better work/life balance so that I'll get more time with my kids and actually have time for my passion projects. Looking forward to talking more about those soon.

I may even finally have a chance to upgrade my personal site's infrastructure and give it some much needed TLC. Here's to hoping :-)
